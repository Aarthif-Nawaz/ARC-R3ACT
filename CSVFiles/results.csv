They say 10-20min but at the end it's 50min minimum  1h at latest  for any kind of restaurant. You can never use your Uber credit  even if you select it  they charge you anyway. They charge you if the restaurant cancel. Delivery don't come to you  you have to move somewhere to pick up your food (but you pay 4 pounds?!),i talk service worst year year they say less restaurant close something km house i imagine they say min end min minimum h latest kind restaurant you never use credit even select charge anyway they charge restaurant cancel delivery come move somewhere pick food pay,Common

1224,App has declined over past year or so: No immediate emailed confirmation when submitting orders. They do this so that you forget when you submitted your order. Their algorithms are designed to manipulate. Consistently hires drivers who scam or lie about their form of transportation.

However  in the past 6 months I've had multiple orders fail to deliver and be canceled after I've waited 45+min  with no attempt from the driver to contact me and absolutely no help from support (other than you weren't charged). It's frustrating to be waiting for up to an hour only to be left empty-handed  and not being charged for something I never received is little consolation. I'll be uninstalling and using a competitor. Edit in response to developer comment: the details are in my conversations with Uber support. If you would like to see them  please let me know what I can reference  since there doesn't seem to be an obvious ticketing system being used by your customer service team.,i used eats lot generally found reliable however past i multiple fail deliver i min attempt driver contact absolutely help support it waiting hour left empty handed something i never received little consolation i competitor edit response developer comment support if would like see please let know i reference since seem obvious ticketing system used customer service team,Common

1400,The app is broken at the time of writing this.

Not sure if restaurant or Uber fault  but in any case Uber tried to compensate with a 5$ discount (the food I paid for was worth more than that)  even though I sent pictures of the wrong order as per request. I'd call it awful service and felt pretty scammed. Don't take me wrong  I'm a regular user of Uber  but Uber Eats does have a pretty bad consumer service and app ain't great.

Also getting someone on a bicycle to deliver meals with hot coffee in isn't a good idea is it?

No way to contact the delivery guys whatsoever to even tell them they got the wrong address. What the hell. They even changed my account already.

My problem came from trying to get a phone number to discuss my order. It was basically impossible. So I go to the online help center and they CHARGED ME FOR IT.

2595,It's not as good as Doordash! 1)There's no bottom to refund a customer right away without calls and wait time.2) they give time  when they don't know how long it'll take to make it. A large pizza in 9 min. No way!!!!! It's 20 min. And many times there's no choice to adjust the time. Neither a bottom to cancel an order for a restaurant.

They reply to them all tho tell us more about your issue they should INSTEAD pay ppl to FIX THE PROBLEMS instead of apologizing for them!,the horrible when works beautiful smart well designed the problem i would guess time i attempt place order i issue cart new error message i hate leaving bad i cant stand eats scroll recent people almost all bad they reply tho tell us issue instead pay fix the instead,Common

When I opened the broth container  a really disgusting smell came out  and almost made me puke  and my friend had the same reaction. There was no way we were gonna eat that  so I threw everything to the trash. After more than a month of back and forth with uber eats  they offered to give me a 5$ coupon. This is a joke  and I'm deleting the app  and will use grubhub instead.

3338,An absolute con! All restaurants have marked up their prices  and Uber charge an extortionate amount on fees on top of that  and delivery costs are far too high.

It's the app allowing people on bicycles to make 2 deliveries that are km apart that is unacceptable. Stop passing the buck to the restaurants. Fix your app.,delivery time delivery way fact heading away us driver made another delivery first yeah good love cold food why eats allow happen edit thing today the food problem unacceptable it app people make apart unacceptable stop passing buck fix app,Common

4080,I've used UberEats 3 times  two of those were missing an item and their response is to tell me I'm lying so they can't work with the restaurant to see why this happened. There must be a better mechanism for validating orders before delivering the food. This seems like a fundamental part of this service which is missing. EDIT: I reached out after the dev reply only to have them again tell me they can't do anything. If they could get my order right it wouldn't be an issue!,i used times two missing item response tell i lying work restaurant see there must better mechanism food this like fundamental part service missing edit i dev reply tell anything if could get order right would issue,Common

We ordered 2x smoothie bowls from kauai on the app. They arrived upside down  and 90% of the contents spilled in the paper bag. The driver left without comment. On informing UberEats - including pictures - they refunded us for only one saying - and I quote We know that you’re not happy with how your dish looks  however we also understand that giving you a credit doesn’t prevent this from happening again.

5122,Orders are cancelled all the time hours after they are placed. I am not sure why Uber allows you to schedule a pickup because it's always after 5pm  nothing before that. Also  if you make an order at 1  it will auto cancel by 3. The fact there is no customer support says everything about Uber. They suck,time i sure schedule pickup always pm nothing also make order auto cancel the fact customer support everything they suck,Common

5124,I wasn't going to write a review but I changed my mind when I kept receiving phone calls about my order not being correct. I specifically ordered Seafood Enchiladas which is listed under that category. They had the driver call me to ask what type of seafood because apparently it only showed seafood and not enchiladas. I ordered chicken chimichangas under that specific category as well. Finally the lady from Guapos got on the phone.

But nooo with Ubereats  you pay full price and they decide whether your food will be Uberpool or not.

5580,Won't run on a google pixel 3a xl. Sad. Edited: And apparently  UberEats can't even give enough effort to actually reply to a negative review. That's a link to their generic help section  not a method of contacting them. So they can't put in enough effort to make the app function on a modern device  and can't put in enough effort to reply to people when they're frustrated that the app won't work on their devices. So in other words  they're throwing out a net to capture as many hapless suckers as possible to waste overblown money on an app that overcharges  doesn't tip restaurants or servers  sneakily raises prices without telling you  won't give you accurate estimates on delivery times  and won't even bother to make sure it'll function at stealing your money. What an absolute load of tripe. No  UberEats  I'm not going to go through the process of navigating through your website's help section  finding a method of contacting you (Which I'm /certain/ you've hidden behind dozens of links because you can't be bothered to actually answer me)  and go through the process of taking a class on learning how to use your website. This went from a nine word review to an over-two-hundred word review because you halfassed your response so very poorly. Food apps are literally the worst. Waste your time spending on another gacha game  you'll get more satisfaction and nutrition out of your life with less time wasted.,wo run sad and apparently even give enough effort actually reply negative review that link generic help section method so put enough effort make app function modern device put enough effort reply people app work so throwing net capture many hapless possible waste overblown money app tip without telling give accurate delivery times even bother make sure function stealing money what absolute load tripe no i going go process help section finding method which i certain hidden behind links actually answer go process taking class learning use this went nine word review two hundred word review response poorly food literally worst waste time spending another game get satisfaction nutrition life less time wasted,Common

6440,Terrible service. The app never tells me before I pay how far away a driver is. This has lead to me ordering food and not receiving it for nearly an hour. More than once. The drivers never come to my door. And to top it off they have possibly the most useless help option on the app. All it does is tell you how to check the status of your order and basically says just wait. We cant control the drivers.

There have been so many times I've hit $14.99 because the majority of restaurants end their costs in .99  and the app won't count it as meeting the $15 minimum.

UBER eats will not offer assistance. Just a refund and $5 credit  whether you spend $20 or $200. The more you use UBER eats the more these types of things occur.

7715,Unsurprisingly  the app is designed to make it difficult to call in a complaint. Additionally  whilenthey push the monthly pass that waives delivery fees - you're no longer able to access restaurants that were further away (that they charged higher delivery fees for). Worse  the restaurants aren't even filtered out of your choices. So if you spent a long chunk of time placing a large order  you only find out you wasted your time AFTER you try placing the order. It's a shameful bait & switch.,app designed make difficult call complaint additionally push monthly pass delivery longer able access away higher delivery worse even so spent long chunk time large order find wasted time after try order it shameful bait switch,Common

Edit2: Here's a solution. Go into the Uber Ride App  add a Favorite Place in your account. That tool does have the pick my location from a map feature. Once you set it up in the Uber Ride App  then it's available as a favorite location on the Uber Eats App. You have a UX problem there. Edit3: Dear customer support. You keep suggesting the same solutions that do not work. There is no option of pin-pointing your delivery address on the map. Try it yourselves before answering back. Try it out on the latest Uber Eats Android version. To give the full details I have Uber Ride and Uber Eats on the same phone and with favorite locations saved at Uber Ride. Somehow I think this is where your BUG is. But for God's sake  test it out before answering. I followed your instructions and there is no option to pin point. Also  read Edit2 for the only workaround I found.,garbage interface impossible give accurate location it allow pick location map edit option pin pointing map there option edit here solution go ride app add favorite place account that tool pick location map feature once set ride app available favorite location eats app you problem edit dear customer support you keep suggesting work there option pin pointing delivery address map try back try latest eats android version to give full i ride eats phone favorite saved ride somehow i think bug but god sake test i option pin point also read edit i found,Common

8082,Good for when you want something besides pizza but it's prohibitively expensive. On top of delivery & service fees  there's an extra fee for orders under $15 (until recently it was $10). The user has no control over who the delivery person is  yet app doesn't always find the best match (i.e.large order given to someone on bike). So service can be unreliable. You can end up paying a lot of $$$ for not a lot of food & unpredictable service.There's cheaper  more reliable options for ordering out,good want something besides pizza prohibitively expensive on top delivery service extra fee recently the user control delivery person yet app always find best match e large order given someone bike so service unreliable you end paying lot lot food unpredictable service there reliable,Common
