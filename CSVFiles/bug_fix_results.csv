Same trip with similar distance the app shows different kms and hence higher charge. Drivers after accepeting a trip keep silent and when called upon they say they are in a far away place and cant come asking us to cancel. Very poor customer care with no agent to talk to. This service should be banned in Sri Lanka and give the cheated money back to customers.

My booking magically disappeared from the app, with no cancellation notice, in spite of the confirmation they sent me earlier.  No one answered their customer support phone number or email address at the time and still now, a full day later.

He reported it to your support team, but he haven't got any replies from them, route map is showing the wrong path, when I go in a way it's showing that I'm going in the other way.   This is my personal opinion regarding this app :  My rating regarding this app is 2/5 and for the drivers 3/5. Before releasing the app to live make sure to release with less bugs.  1. Location Services should be improved ( Location is not accurate ) 2. Make your drivers comfortable , because all drivers are complaining about pick me, they are your clients . without them you are zero.  3.
