My problem with Uber eats is that they do not verify the people receiving the food properly. Even though I have was given a refund that will be put back in my account for maybe 3-5 business days  someone got a free meal off of me!!!! What about the time that was robbed from me along with my food????,my problem eats verify people food properly even though i given refund put back account maybe business days someone got free meal what time along food

Horrible customer service was ignored by multiple representatives regarding an order! I do not recommend this app UberEats does not value their loyal customers and will not refund you for food that you never recieved! I paid good money for good food and the logical solution to failure of service is to refund which UberEats carelessly and unprofessionally rejects to do. Use DoorDash GrubHub Postmates literally any other app than this one! Very upsetting!,horrible customer service multiple regarding order i recommend app value loyal refund food never i good money good food logical solution failure service refund carelessly unprofessionally use literally app one very upsetting
For someone who doesn't currently have a working vehicle and enjoys dining out this app is perfect. I've used it for a while have friends and family who use it and it's pretty good. There's a wide variety of places to choose from and I like the fact that I can tip directly from the app. I also really like the fact that it shows me what the driver looks like their name and what car they drive. Definitely going to keep using it.,for someone currently working vehicle dining app perfect i used family use pretty good there wide variety choose i like fact i tip directly app i also really like fact driver like name car drive definitely going keep

Update 3/9 I would recommend for anyone thinking of downloading this app to not do so. Simply you cannot even call anyone other than the driver when something has gone wrong. More often than not something does go wrong. Do not download. 12/19 Hey so recently tried using the app again after some time of not using it and honestly it's garbage. You can tell there a severe disconnect between UberEats and the restaurants.

The app will change your order without you knowing  the drivers are either late or don't ensure they even have your order not someone else's when they go to pick up and deliver  and the customer service representatives are a joke to try to deal with. They are a hassle to try and fix anything and when you are charged fees wrongly  they would rather take your money and give you their app credit instead of your money back. Don't waste your time.,the app change order without knowing either late ensure even order someone else go pick deliver customer service joke try deal they hassle try fix anything wrongly would rather take money give app credit instead money back do waste time

Why can't I turn off notifications for special offers? I turn the notifications on so my watch will tell me when an order is arriving soon but then my watch starts buzzing for some mystery promotion that is just a thinly veiled way to get me to open the app around lunch time.

I joined 2 days ago and have ordered twice in as many days. I injured myself and can't walk or drive. It's been 8 days and doesn't look like I will be mobile at least for another week. I found Uber Eats  joined immediately  and all my orders have been within 30 minutes and exactly what I ordered. This is the best for anyone in a tight spot  too busy or who just doesn't want to deal with going out. I'll be using Uber Eats again today. I highly recommend to this app.,i days ago ordered twice many days i injured walk drive it days look like i mobile least another week i found eats immediately within exactly i ordered this best anyone tight spot busy want deal going i eats today i highly recommend app
Uber eats are disgraceful. Orders get cancelled constantly but only after they make you wait hours first. Customer service is absoloutely shocking and completely unhelpful. Overall terrible experience.

UberEats consistently disappoints me. Multiple times I've had rude delivery people  cold food  unexplained delays without any apologies  oh and you can't cancel once they're delayed! That only proves how aware you are of this issue. I would highly recommend just walking to whatever store you want to order from because it'll still be faster and a better experience than what UberEats provides. To the copy paste customer service reply below: I did. Your system either deleted it or you ignored me or you're taking your 5 days to respond after you've already charged my credit card. This is a consistent issue in multiple different countries. Your system clearly isn't working.,consistently multiple times i rude delivery people cold food unexplained without oh cancel that aware issue i would highly recommend walking whatever store want order still faster better experience to copy paste customer service reply i your system either taking days respond already credit card this consistent issue multiple different your system clearly working

Such a ripoff. Service fees  delivery fees plus an increased food cost because they charge the vendor a % so they have to jack up pricing. A typical order is usually $12-15 more than pickup  before tip.

I ordered some food and the driver picked it up then cancelled the order and drove away with $56 worth of food ((it was for a party)). I called customer support and they even checked and confirmed that he never even came to the designated location. Honestly they should be able to check so to avoid situations like this bc i was pretty angry when it happened. Giving it 3 stars bc they offered me a $5 off coupon as compensation so i guess it makes it hurt a little less.,i ordered food driver picked order drove away worth food party i customer support even checked confirmed never even came location honestly able check avoid like pretty angry giving coupon compensation guess hurt little less

On the rare occasion the app actually works  the selection of restaurants is depressing  the customer service is abysmal-to-nonexistent  and more often than not your order will be wrong anyway.

Also I am writing this review second time so maybe they are even deleting the reviews. Call the restaurant or use a trustful app that 100% delivers your food.,your order delivery mood prepared getting food notified not going use app multiple times also i writing review second time maybe even call restaurant use trustful app food

2 out of 2 orders placed were missing items. On the 2nd occasion I was told there would be no refund (seemingly based on the fact that they couldn't possibly get things wrong so often). Won't be using them again  app deleted.,missing on nd occasion i told would refund seemingly based fact could possibly get wrong often wo app

My friend didn't get any of their food. ETA was 40min  delivery took 1hr 20min. Food was cold.

I used the app whilst it was loadshedding. The restaurant accepted the order only to find out 1 hour later our order was never prepared due to the restaurant not having power. I personally think I should have been informed about this when my order was placed instead of waiting for delivery and I was constantly checking the status of the order via the app. Hopefully my next experience is better.,i used app whilst the restaurant accepted order find hour later order never prepared due restaurant power i personally think i informed order instead waiting delivery i constantly status order via app hopefully next experience better

Uber is great in regards to deliver your food  however  they don't take any responsibility for missing items  I had more than 4 missing items till I decided to share my experience  I received a nice message that within 24h  someone will respond  but unfortunately no response till now. (One month ago) And today it happened again  and no one to talk about it. So Uber this my feedback back to you.,great deliver food however take responsibility missing i missing till i decided share experience i received nice message within h someone respond unfortunately response till one month ago and today one talk so feedback back

Do not use this app!!! They are consistently 20 minutes past the quoted latest delivery time  and they delivered someone else's order before mine and still charged me the full delivery fee! I ordered $40 worth of food and when I get it it is cold and soggy. I will never use this service again. There is too much competition from door dash and the like to justify using a second rate app and service like this. Way to loose a customer.,do use app they consistently past latest delivery time someone else order mine still full delivery fee i ordered worth food i get cold soggy i never use service there much competition door dash like justify second rate app service like way loose customer
No support at all  I faced an issues many times  the only thing that they are doing is to provide a dash board if you receive your food late or garbage or even if the driver eat some of it they don't do anything and they don't care. Don't waste you time. (This message after their reply): nothing happened they only throw your compliance to a third team  until you feel bored😒. The last thing they will say its the driver issue (third party) we will make sure that he will never deliver 😑,no support i faced many times thing provide dash board receive food late garbage even driver eat anything care do waste time this message reply nothing throw compliance third team feel unamused face the last thing say driver issue third party make sure never deliver expressionless face
Absolutely appalling customer service. Uber eats are rated 1 star by over 10 000 people on trust pilot and for good reason. The customer service 'help' team are useless  you cannot phone any number to complain and there is no accountability.

I've never used an app this big that's this consistently bad and buggy. Random crashes  disconnects  and missing notifications plague this thing. Every delivery will visually break at some point along the way  as though your driver got in a crash. Closing the app and reopening it is the only way to check progress  no matter what version you're on. Speaking of versions  updates to the app add ads and bloat instead of bugfixes. Thanks  but I don't care what other people order.

Ive been using uber eats for the past month but TODAY this lady comes and drops off my food (super friendly) but she didnt even realize my order was wrong.

What the hell? Not attentive  horrible service,upset i never leave today worst service eats past month today lady comes food super friendly didnt even realize order wrong i would understand place item right back drink wrong size i come upstair realize missing chicken small what hell not attentive horrible service
Update 2020! They are still the worst. The drivers never double-check the orders  the restaurants never check to make sure they got everything right  and even if they deliver a hot  inedible pile of garbage  you're given the run-around and a $5 credit. The Ubereats service is the worst  customer service is worse than that  and they will straight up steal your money. Use someone  ANYONE else.,update they still worst the never double check never check make sure got everything right even deliver hot inedible pile garbage given run around credit the service worst customer service worse straight steal money use someone anyone else

Why is it that UberEats refuses to assist customers when the restaurant fails us?! Customer service is useless and so is management. They just want to keep your money   even if your food is bad .

I'm extremely dissatisfied and unhappy!!!,i would give half star i could nd time i ordered eats said delivery taken food cold i never use wont recommend anyone i extremely dissatisfied unhappy
Horrible service my food came cold and it was disgusting and the delivery driver had his wife in the car with hem because I had a dog he was scared to come out of the car and walk to the door of my budling to give me my food I had to wave at hem so he would finally get out of the car and give me my food which was disgusting and I contacted Uber eats they only gave me 5 dollar credit instead of full refund horrible service,horrible service food came cold disgusting delivery driver wife car hem i dog come car walk door give food i wave hem would finally get car give food disgusting i eats gave dollar credit instead full refund horrible service

They are very rude. They justify serving you cold food instead of hot and take the money without even a gesture. I am fed ip with ubereats. They keep on changing time of deliveries and bad customer service. Going to the others now. Enough is enough. Spent way too much money with their bad attitude.,they rude they justify serving cold food instead hot take money without even gesture i fed they keep time bad customer service going enough enough spent way much money bad attitude

Used to work really well. I use uber to order mcdonalds all the time. Now it's always saying that every restaurant I used to order from now can't be ordered from? Then 5 minutes later it says mcdonalds can now deliver. Then 10 minutes later its unavailable again? It's really aggravating. I go to order a ton of food for my friend and family and am willing to spend a ton of money only for it to suddenly say that its unavailable??? Can you fix this? Also  a lot of promotions don't work.,used work really well i use order time now always saying every restaurant i used order ordered then later deliver then later unavailable it really aggravating i go order ton food friend family willing spend ton money suddenly say unavailable can fix also lot work

Have used this app a few time and it has just got worse and worse. Food last night could not even eat was awful and the driver called so many times as he said he could not find our house food was cold by the time he got to us.

There are to many charges not worth ordering when you have to pay three times the price for simply fast food. I say this because I wanted to order breakfast it came to $8.70 and I was being charged an extra two dollar's because it wasn't over $30 plus I still had tax and delivery to pay then to top it of if you want to cancel an order because it would take to long you are charged to cancel uber eats is garbage just another way to gouge people's hard earned money,there many worth pay three times price simply fast food i say i order breakfast came i extra two dollar plus i still tax delivery pay top want cancel order would take long cancel eats garbage another way gouge people hard money

All good when things go well  total scam when they don't I ordered lunch for two people. Two full menus  burgers  side dishes  drinks  the works. After 1 hour the food gets here and it's only 1 menu! I try to contact uber eats about this  there is no way to get in direct contact with them (phone  chat)  you can only leave them a message to which they will reply in max 24 hours. Been using uber eats for years but if this is how they treat their customers I'm uninstalling the app now  bye!,all good go well total scam i ordered lunch two people two full side works after hour food menu i try contact eats way get direct contact phone chat leave message reply been eats treat i app bye

Food came very undercooked. They wouldn't approve a refund even after the restaurant said they'd refund me. Uninstalled and cancelled my pass. Their customer service really doesn't care about anything but making money. Whether the food is edible or not. Good riddance. I'll use another app from now on. Always a problem with this app. Always. It's more of an inconvenience ordering breakfast when you can't leave the house from a kid being asleep early in the morning. It's late or inedible.,food came they would approve refund even restaurant said would refund uninstalled pass their customer service really care anything making money whether food edible good riddance i use another app always problem app always it inconvenience breakfast leave house asleep early morning it late inedible

I received an email offering 15euros for my first order. I ended up paying the full amount without any reduction. There was no way to apply the reduction during the order and once the order placed no way to cancel it.

Their service can be very good. I have managed restaurant to mouth within 9 minutes before. However  they won't accept any responsibility for the service they provide. You may have a delivery driver admit they don't know there area  as I did  then get lost  then arrive with the ice cold drinks next to the hot food inside the insulated bag. My food couldn't be resuscitated. Just be wary  they won't refund  won't accept any responsibility and will reply with automated messages/templates.,their service good i restaurant mouth within however accept responsibility service provide you may delivery driver admit know area i get lost arrive ice cold next hot food inside insulated bag my food could just wary refund accept responsibility reply

It was a charge that was process through my PayPal. At one point I called the 1800 number they had on their account. Got transferred like 5 or 6 times. Only to be told the same damn thing.

Uber Eats has been acquired by Zomato. Once you install this app  they'll redirect you to Zomato. So it's better to install Zomato instead of Uber Eats.,eats acquired once install app redirect so better install instead eats
The app works well. My disappointment lies in the fact that there is a service fee on top of a delivery fee. Couple those with taxes and a tip and I am essentially paying for another meal. As if those concerns weren't alarming  by the time I order my meal  the delivery time is almost an hour if not an hour. So  I've now paid in fees for an extra meal and the original order I've placed is delivered to me an hour later and cold or dry. (chicken  etc.) There's no discount for returning customers.,the app works well my disappointment fact service fee top delivery fee couple tip i essentially paying another meal as alarming time i order meal delivery time almost hour hour so i extra meal original order i hour later cold dry chicken there discount
Uber eats is quite literally the best app on any device. 🔥🔥🔥,eats quite literally best app device fire fire fire
Trash,trash
It's a good system but if you have problems with an order (for example a missing items) all you can do is send a support ticket. There's no number to call or no one to instant message which is quite concerning. I got a response hours later which is not good enough so I will stick with deliveroo,it good system order example missing send support ticket there number call one instant message quite concerning i got response later good enough i stick

Got any coupons? 😃,got grinning face big eyes
Price gouging at its finest. $1 menu items are $3+ from McD. These guys are not only charging deliver fees  but they're also double to triple charging on food.,price menu these charging deliver also double triple charging food
Update: Despite Uber's misleading reply to this review  my issue was NOT resolved. Took $20 because they didn't let me put in an delivery address  used the wrong one and wouldn't let me correct it. The support staff refused to fix it and just told me I was getting charged anyway and to just get it right when [I] order again. Uber steals your driver's tips. Uber steals your money. Uber never fixes their broken app.,update despite misleading reply review issue not resolved took let put delivery address used wrong one would let correct the support staff fix told i getting anyway get right i order driver money never broken app
Excellent service!,excellent service
ABSOLUTE SCAM!! My order kept getting pushed back which was irritating to start. Then when I tried to cancel my order  it told me I had to pay $24! There wasn't anyone who had picked the order up and it still said the restaurant was preparing the order. DO NOT USE THIS APP!,absolute scam my order kept getting back irritating start then i tried cancel order told i pay there anyone picked order still said restaurant order do not use this app

The Customer service did not care to take my feedback. so I'll just type it here Not only the application have a very limited number of restaurants ( 2-3 ) but also it took literally 2 hours or more ( still ongoing ) to deliver an order I hate the second I ever thought of downloading and using such an awful app. I'd advise canceling the service in Egypt before it destroys what Uber app reputation,the customer service care take feedback i type not application limited number also took literally still ongoing deliver order i hate second i ever thought awful app i would advise service app reputation
Great drivers and usually on time!,great usually time
No good app. I have had the app crash on me sticking during search. Last update may have helped some . App has stopped before delivery where you can't change payments. You cant turn off uber cash. All the charges that makes your credit card stop working after a few orders in a day. Best thing bought the app was the response from developer.This app does not let you cancel food or change addressees and does wierd stuff like change my address..,no good app i app crash sticking search last update may app stopped delivery change you cant turn cash all credit card stop working day best thing bought app response developer this app let cancel food change stuff like change address
Good,good
For the most part the app works great  but more and more frequently it's been bugging out  with saying places I've ordered from tons of times are too far  or that a restaurant that was available when I selected it is no longer available when I go to check out. I've also had communication errors where I ordered something and the driver doesnt have it on his order check list. They are quick to give you a refund if something is missing or wrong  and generally very helpful.,for part app works great frequently saying i ordered times far restaurant available i selected longer available i go check i also communication i ordered something driver doesnt order check list they quick give refund something missing wrong generally helpful

Can't set the exact location of my apt it just let me select the neighborhood name but the location for the delivery guy always shows in the middle of the area. Also payment method switches randomly I never use cash and last time out of nowhere I was being asked to pay in cash. For the amount of presence that Uber has in the world it's a shame the app has those type of bugs that can be easily fixed by a good developer.,ca set exact location apt let select neighborhood name location delivery guy always middle area also payment method randomly i never use cash last time nowhere i pay cash for amount presence world shame app type easily fixed good developer

I will never use uber eats again.,i ordered food reasonable time i received food tipped delivery person i tipped card there charge food also separate charge dollar tip why should i tip door i never use eats

I got hacked 5 times within 48 hours and Uber Eats did absolutely nothing to help me. I contacted the support & provided them with all the information they claimed I needed. They suggested it might be one of my family members  but I told them that I was the only one with access and it was clear it was not me ordering since the orders were all within short times spans in Florida  California  Texas  Illinois and New York. They never got back to me afterwards.

I enjoy the convenience and the large amount of options. I was injured so I used this app more often during that period  and the service was reliable  quick  and professional. The drivers were almost always punctual and friendly. However  the service fee is a ridiculous way to charge two delivery fees. It's unreasonable. Also  I can't remove any payment method I add  so by now I have a long list of card numbers  some of them even expired and there is no place to ask for technical assistance.,i enjoy convenience large amount i injured i used app often period service reliable quick professional the almost always punctual friendly however service fee ridiculous way charge two delivery it unreasonable also i remove payment method i add i long list card even place ask technical assistance

All are FAQs and my issue isn't listed. What am I supposed to do? And how is there no option to contact the restaurant from the order status screen? Or give me more details about my already placed order (payment method  address.).

They don't do there due diligence to ensure every restaurant  as well as  food delevery person is up to par.

I've also had numerous problems with delivery instructions.,used love app delivery charge well food i understand go increase delivery charge marking food restaurant much i also numerous delivery

What a truly terrible app paired with a company that already thinks it's too successful to offer quality customer service. If you order from this atrocity  triple-check your delivery address and payment method because the app doesn't have a verification step for either. If you accidentally order to the wrong address  you will have to either take the loss and let your delivery driver eat the meal that you paid for or hope that your driver is cooperative and nice enough to meet you,what truly terrible app paired company already successful offer quality customer service if order atrocity triple check delivery address payment method app verification step either if accidentally order wrong address either take loss let delivery driver eat meal hope driver nice enough meet

Fees are way too high. It's cheaper to get an uber to the restaurant  pick up your food and head back home.,way high it get restaurant pick food head back home
Not enough oversight if a restaurant delivers really late. No alternative to 'call them'. If they dont answer then no plan B. Food arrived over an 1hrs late. Ubereats should know this and offer discounts from the offending restaurant if this happens.,not enough oversight restaurant really late no alternative call if dont answer plan b food hrs late know offer restaurant

Had two terrible experiences in a row. First one we waited over 80 minutes to receive our order. No traffic or any peak hours that could have affected the order. Second time one third of a Large coldrink was spilled out  and everything was wet. To top that  two burgers was missing from the meal  and instead there was a jalapeno burger in their place  we dont eat jalapenos! The items that was received  was cold and not fresh. Never ordering from Uber eats again. Waste of time and not worth it,had two terrible row first one receive order no traffic peak could affected order second time one third large everything wet to top two missing meal instead place dont eat the received cold fresh never eats waste time worth

I received a totally wrong order from them and they refused to take responsibility for this problem telling me that I had to call the restaurant and cancel the order! Why would I cancel the order? I need to eat and this is why I ordered in the first place. Getting the wrong items is your responsibility since I have no control or knowledge of what is inside the bag. The food prices are more expensive than it's price on the restaurants. Would never use it without a 50% discount or something.,i received totally wrong order take responsibility problem telling i call restaurant cancel order why would i cancel order i need eat i ordered first place getting wrong responsibility since i control knowledge inside bag the food expensive price would never use without discount something
I talk about the service. Worst year after year. They say less fees if the restaurant is close to you  but it's 4£ for something at 1km from your house  I can't imagine farest. They say 10-20min but at the end it's 50min minimum  1h at latest  for any kind of restaurant. You can never use your Uber credit  even if you select it  they charge you anyway. They charge you if the restaurant cancel. Delivery don't come to you  you have to move somewhere to pick up your food (but you pay 4 pounds?!),i talk service worst year year they say less restaurant close something km house i imagine they say min end min minimum h latest kind restaurant you never use credit even select charge anyway they charge restaurant cancel delivery come move somewhere pick food pay

Terrible. Two orders places through Uber eats. The first time we received someone elses order and it took til the next day to get a refund - by which point it was too late. Second time we had food missing and Uber refused to refund as I'd had to complain twice in a row!,terrible two eats the first time received someone order took til next day get refund point late second time food missing refund i would complain twice row
Doesnt work i keep ordering food but the wrong item keep turning up and then when I ask for a refund because the only edible thing on a £22 order is £1.60 worth of hash brown they give you £8 back seem reasonable to me,doesnt work keep food wrong item keep turning i ask refund edible thing order worth hash brown give back seem reasonable
useless I can't use it because I am very rural backpacker sorry for the strange language but all the time if I watch sth on YouTube the add comes on I really have no use for it just go out and go in the restaurant by yourself there is nothing wrong about this but don't hide behind the internetti if you are hungry you never get good conversations s,useless i use i rural sorry strange language time i watch add comes i really use go go restaurant nothing wrong hide behind hungry never get good

Thank you for reminding me why I chose data science instead of mobile development. Not even a company as large and shameful in employee treatment as Uber can get it right. 90 Mins ago did I order  45 minutes the driver has been at the restaurant. To those reading reviews I'd recommend doordash because if something goes wrong you can actually contact them. EDIT: Response is exactly what I mean. Not even Uber knows their own features. You can't contact in these situations. It says wait.,thank i chose data science instead mobile development not even company large shameful employee treatment get right ago i order driver restaurant to reading i would recommend something goes wrong actually contact edit response exactly i mean not even you contact it wait

Overall good but this last time I spent 15 bucks plus tip on a simple McDonalds meal from the location down the street (less than a mile away). It was preparing for a good 40 minutes  was delivered fairly quick. I got a soggy cold burger with fries the same temperature of my drink. Overall very disappointed to have spend twice the amount I would have spend to get it myself if i was off work. I paid more for below standard 😕,overall good last time i spent plus tip simple meal location street less mile away it good fairly quick i got soggy cold temperature drink overall disappointed spend twice amount i would spend get work i standard confused face

Long delivery wait for up to an hour. Not impressed. No direct contact w. CS. ********* Reply to UE. You might want to check your messages. If you would - then you'd see I already raised this concern w. you. Check your feedbacks. Btw  one time my order was damaged by driver wo even advising me. Ended up waiting for over an hour to find out no delivery would be made. Offered $10 discount  for dinner that we did not have  which they did not even credit. Terrible.,long delivery wait hour not no direct contact w reply you might want check if would would see i already raised concern w check one time order driver wo even ended waiting hour find delivery would made discount dinner even credit terrible

Horrible customer experience. Use to be good. Before if there was a problem with the order  they would fix the issue. Almost every order has an issue now in the last 6 months.

Won't be using the app again.,horrible customer experience use good before problem order would fix issue almost every order issue last customer support anything help walking also pointless wo app

Do Not Use This App! I work in the food service industry and deal with the other side of your order. Drivers often arrive 15-30 minutes after they are supposed to. That's even if they arrive at all. Customers have come to our store to pick up their order because there's no way to contact the driver or UberEats after waiting hours for their delivery and watching the driver's GPS location never move. Use Door Dash instead. They are always early for pick up and are so much more professional.,do not use this app i work food service industry deal side order often arrive supposed that even arrive come store pick order way contact driver waiting delivery watching driver location never move use door dash instead they always early pick much professional

I ordered a meal for 2 using this app and after delivery realized that I was missing half my order. I was confused as I was charged for both meals. There is no way to get any sort of immediate assistance and I emailed customer service but didn't get so much as an auto reply. There is no way to leave feedback about the driver (other than a thumbs down)  see his rating  and this guy apparently pocketed the extra cash instead of filling my whole order.

Uber eats is the worst app  I had a very disappointing experience today when I ordered food for lunch and it took way too long when I tried to cancel the order  the support also took way too long to answer wow what a bad bad experience.

I'm not sure what is going on with Uber Eats  but I'm being charged days later and then refunded and charged again  with no explanation from Uber Eats in an email! There is no way to talk to a real person when you need to figure out the random charges! The Help section is laughable. Thinking I might switch to Doordash or SkipTheDishes permanently  never had problems with them. And you think you are saving $ with the way they have changed delivery fees  but you don't  they get you with a $2 fee,i sure going eats i days later explanation eats there way talk real person need figure random the help section laughable thinking i might switch permanently never and think saving way delivery get fee

I had a terrible experience with ubereats I received an email from uber eats claiming that I have not paid my driver the full amount of my order and that 242.80 is due(which is the full amount). I have  no doubt  paid my driver more than the full amount. I gave him R270 (I paid extra as a tip) so I was outraged by this email. I wasn't even alone  I was accompanied by my cousin to the front gate. Why would the driver give us the food but not take the money? Does that make sense?,i terrible experience i received eats i driver full amount order due full amount i doubt driver full amount i gave r i extra tip i i even alone i cousin front gate why would driver give us food take money does make sense
Used to work great and usually was faster than DoorDash but there's just so many bugs lately. For a while there was a credit card issue where any CC you put it would say invalid (DD was working). For the longest time I've been experiencing a bug you see in many other reviews  it can't pull up any addresses. I'm a former Android dev; I've tried the basics clearing cache  clearing app data  reinstalling  force-killing  nothing works. Uber's had so many layoffs so that's part of it I'm sure...,used work great usually faster many lately for credit card issue put would say invalid working for time i bug see many pull i former android dev i tried clearing cache clearing app data force killing nothing works many part i sure

App has declined over past year or so: No immediate emailed confirmation when submitting orders. They do this so that you forget when you submitted your order. Their algorithms are designed to manipulate. Consistently hires drivers who scam or lie about their form of transportation. Order receipt fails to include name  time  and pay method; info is too limited. Service fees are higher than competitors like GrubHub and DoorDash. Promotions are unrealistic. Overall  there are better options.,app declined past year no immediate confirmation they forget order their designed manipulate consistently scam lie form transportation order receipt include name time pay method limited service higher like unrealistic overall better
I ordered my food. food did not come but delivery was marked as delivered. Driver was unable to be contact throughout the order and didnt bother to contact me. There is a reception at my place that will gladly take order if the driver was unable to find me (which was weird because I was searching for him). I went to the extent and asked the neighbourhood building if there was a food delivery but nothing. waited half an hour just to have me and my friend left starving.DENIED REFUND AS WELL! 0/5,i ordered food food come delivery marked driver unable contact throughout order didnt bother contact there reception place gladly take order driver unable find weird i searching i went extent building food delivery nothing half hour friend left refund as well
I've used Uber Eats a lot and generally found it to be reliable. However  in the past 6 months I've had multiple orders fail to deliver and be canceled after I've waited 45+min  with no attempt from the driver to contact me and absolutely no help from support (other than you weren't charged). It's frustrating to be waiting for up to an hour only to be left empty-handed  and not being charged for something I never received is little consolation. I'll be uninstalling and using a competitor. Edit in response to developer comment: the details are in my conversations with Uber support. If you would like to see them  please let me know what I can reference  since there doesn't seem to be an obvious ticketing system being used by your customer service team.,i used eats lot generally found reliable however past i multiple fail deliver i min attempt driver contact absolutely help support it waiting hour left empty handed something i never received little consolation i competitor edit response developer comment support if would like see please let know i reference since seem obvious ticketing system used customer service team

By far the worst out of the food delivery services. I love Uber but Uber eats consistently has issues. The arrival time is Always longer than estimated many times by 20-30 min more.

Not worth it,by far worst food delivery i love eats consistently the arrival time always longer many times min food quality last order food they credit never not worth

I've been waiting for months now.,worst support ever i sent multiple order completely wrong i lying get refund i account would i also data request said would send i waiting
no way to make instant complain inside the app. food is still preparing after order placed for 1.x hour. And when try to cancel the order  the refund deduct the delivery fee  which is waived during payment. super poor experience,way make instant complain inside app food still order x hour and try cancel order refund deduct delivery fee payment super poor experience

Terrible customer service. Restaurant delivers wrong order and do not answer their phone. Uber eats 'support' took 9 hours to respond. Sent them a picture of the wrong order (which may I add  I did not eat) and their 'support' claims there is nothing that they can do. The delivery driver who was a apparently going to be a female on a bike ended up being a male in a car  the food order wasnt sealed. I'm out of pocket  but much wiser. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,terrible customer service restaurant wrong order answer phone eats took respond sent picture wrong order may i add i eat nothing the delivery driver apparently going female bike ended male car food order wasnt sealed i pocket much wiser avoid at all

I received a wrong order and Uber gave no support whatsoever at the time despite the restaurant itself being helpful. I had guests over who had to go back hungry because Uber refused to send any kind of support.  Uber should make sure that their delivery drivers ensure that they are picking up the correct order at the restaurant itself. It's Uber's responsibility that the correct order reaches the customer else their is no need of a delivery service like this.,i received wrong order gave support whatsoever time despite restaurant helpful i go back hungry send kind support make sure delivery ensure correct order restaurant it responsibility correct order customer else need delivery service like

Terrible customer service!! Even though it took over an hour my order to still NEVER get picked up I tried to change the address to my home addres instead of my job  my order was cancelled and I won't be refunded.

Can cancel your order at anytime. Even when the food is a minute away. Calling them does nothing but give you a refund.,can cancel order even food minute away calling nothing give refund
Excelente!,excelente
Been using this app a while and I'm not sure why. The fees are pretty steep and in my experience they don't like to bring utensils even when you hit the button. It seems they removed the delivery note section recently as well but that's not crucial I guess.,been app i sure the pretty steep experience like bring even hit button it removed delivery note section recently well crucial i guess

Uber eats is the worst. My order took over an hour. 3 people were listed to pick it up then kept cancelling the pick up. Meanwhile there is no option for cancel in the app or a damn phone number to call!!! So you sit and wait over an hour helplessly. I'd pick the damn order up but I cant cancel it!!! Then they charge a service fee and delivery fee. Ridiculous !!,eats worst my order took hour people listed pick kept pick meanwhile option cancel app damn phone number call so sit wait hour helplessly i would pick damn order i cant cancel then charge service fee delivery fee ridiculous
Well downloaded the app because had email saying  first time user would receive 20% up to 10$ off first order  uhggg that did not happen. 😤.,well app saying first time user would receive first order happen face steam nose
Good,good
Very annoying that the app is giving me an invalid payment option against everyone of my cards  just because I am in travel. It took a token amount nicely enough but refuses to use the payment method for actual orders. Completely useless! And has let me down just when I need it!,very annoying app giving invalid payment option everyone i travel it took token amount nicely enough use payment method actual completely useless and let i need
The app is broken at the time of writing this. The reason it'll stay two stars for now is because contacting Uber to provide feedback of issues concerning the app is next to impossible and the main website offers no resolution. The email listed states You've contacted an email address that is not monitored  and so your request has not reached our support team. I will not continue looking for how to provide feedback for your issue.,the app broken time writing the reason stay two provide feedback concerning app next impossible main resolution the listed you address request support team i continue looking provide feedback issue
Don't waste your time with this app.They will take your order and if it's not over $50 the drivers take it upon themselves to cancel and you're stuck in the lurch for almost an hour. No food  you can get your money back but you're back where you started + now you get the privilege of being hangry. Not a. Isolated incident either...3rd and final time!!,do waste time app they take order take upon cancel stuck lurch almost hour no food get money back back get privilege not isolated incident either rd final time
uber os the worst app ever first you say my email isnt valid then you tell me its already registered you should fire your tech people because they clearly suck at there job you will never recive any of my money i hope you go out of buisness,os worst app ever first say valid tell already registered fire tech people clearly suck job never money hope go

Customer service is AWFUL. It's a joke. And when the app stopped identifying any restaurants  the customer service rep jaut read if a script about some ridiculous update they were making and to call back in an hour or two or send an email. When I asked what email address  again she read off a script that didn't mention any email address.,customer service awful it joke and app stopped customer service rep read script ridiculous update making call back hour two send when i address read script mention address

Deceptive pricing  they do not show you the booking fee any longer until your nearly done with order.

Just as unreliable as all the other apps when it comes to tracking your order's progress. It would be AWESOME if the drivers would underestimate the speed of delivery rather than overestimating it.,just unreliable comes order progress it would awesome would underestimate speed delivery rather

I would give it a 0 if I could.

Their customer service is terribly ridiculous. When you call and detective your reason for calling the first thing they say is is there anything else that you need assistance with.... didn't I just tell you  it's like their blatantly ignoring you. In addition my driver cancelled my order 2 HOURS AFTER I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR it. Uber customer service called me to apologize and instructed me to reorder and I would be refunded and when did and called they refused. They've lost me as a good cust.,their customer service terribly ridiculous when call detective reason calling first thing say anything else need assistance i tell like blatantly in addition driver order after i had been waiting for customer service apologize instructed reorder i would they lost good
I get promo emails that aren't easy to navigate to then the promo isn't even honored. They'll use all types of loopholes to not honor the promotions.,i get easy navigate even they use honor
Ordered delivery and a couple items were missing  went to try to report missing items and the app wouldn't allow me to kept giving errors but everything else works. Sounds like they're just trying to scam,ordered delivery couple missing went try report missing app would allow kept giving everything else works like trying scam

I give it 3 stars because the service is really great but I'm sick of getting bicycles delivery during winter and receiving my food cold.,i give service really great i sick getting delivery winter food cold
The app would be better if the customer service aspect would improve. The app constantly goes down when you ask for a refund due to missing items. The delivery workers are polite. Unfortunately  restaurant staff and the internal app processes could use a lot of improvement. Until the refunding process is fixed  I do not recommend.,the app would better customer service aspect would improve the app constantly goes ask refund due missing the delivery polite unfortunately restaurant staff internal app could use lot improvement until process fixed i recommend
My experience was terrible I keep entering my email address and it keeps telling me that that's not my email address associated with my phone number I've been having the same email for 10 years and y'all need to take a shower system because I've been having the same phone number for 10 years fix your system or you want to be missing out on a lot of people downloading this app because your information is inaccurate,my experience terrible i keep entering address telling address associated phone number i need take shower system i phone number fix system want missing lot people app information inaccurate
Fast and easy I like that,fast easy i like
Canceled. And havent heard anything about a refund.,and havent anything refund
Item prices are more expensive that getting them in-store. Delivery men take their sweet time staying for 30 mims before finally moving. And missed order notes for almost every order.,item expensive getting store delivery men take sweet time finally moving and order almost every order
Until the company decides to fix the part of the app where you report missing items from your delivery  it can just go away. Three times now I've ordered from different places and parts were missing or messed up. I go into the app  go into help  try to report the missing or messed up order to get back the money that I spent on something I didn't get  only to have the app tell me that something went wrong. With no actual way to call them  I keep getting screwed out of my own money and I'm done,until company fix part app report missing delivery go away three times i ordered different missing i go app go help try report missing order get back money i spent something i get app tell something went wrong with actual way call i keep getting screwed money i done
So buggy my god,so buggy god

We just ordered a classic mc donalds with 3 sandwichs some fries and desserts but when we opened the bag  we can't found any sandwichs .So like anyone   we gone on the help option to signal missing items and then we just have a sending error each time we try to send the report .Is this a joke? We are actually trying for more than an hour to get some help but the phone support is telling us to go back on application and application reports aren't working at all.Why is a report option down ???,we ordered classic bag found so like anyone gone help option signal missing sending error time try send report is joke we actually trying hour get help phone support telling us go back application application working why report option

Terrible customer service and courier provision. I'd suggest using another food delivery app rather than Ubereats or Just Eat since Ubereats and Just Eat allow you to make orders when couriers aren't available which leads to sometimes receiving your food cold or in some cases. Receiving your food at a point where you don't have time to eat it (alot of delays are the result of this problem  and they won't reimburse you since the company functions on investment capital  in case you were curious),terrible customer service courier provision i would suggest another food delivery app rather just eat since just eat allow make available sometimes food cold food point time eat result problem reimburse since company investment capital case curious

El código (70marzo) que me facilitan en el correo no vale. Lo introduzco y aparece como promoción disponible cuando hago el pedido  pero no se descuenta nada.

Troppo spesso capita che scelgo cosa ordinare  proseguo per pagare  e in ultimo mi viene comunicato che il ristorante è troppo lontano  e sono costretto ad annullare l'ordine. Inoltre l'app è piena di bug e risulta inferiore alla quelle della concorrenza.

Thieves with zero customer support! We placed an order for a subway  with clear instructions to deliver. The driver text to say he was outside  we responded immediately (under 30 seconds) however by this stage he had left. He made no effort whatsoever to complete the delivery. We have tried to appeal the purchase after struggling to find anyway to contact uber however have heard nothing in response. The drivers and uber have worked out they can get away with this easily with no repercussions,zero customer support we order subway clear deliver the driver text say outside immediately however stage left he made effort whatsoever complete delivery we tried appeal purchase struggling find anyway contact however nothing response the worked get away easily

In 2018 I wrote a review based on other people's opinions and uninstalled the UberEats app. A couple of months later  I downloaded the app and started using it's services. I wish I had done so earlier and given the app a try rather than going off the thoughts of others. I have had no issues with the app itself. I love how I can see where my order is and track it until it's outside my home. It is just like Uber and allows me to rate my meals and the delivery person. Sorry UberEats. U r great!,in i wrote review based people uninstalled app a couple later i app i wish i done given app try rather going i app i love i see order track outside home it like rate delivery person sorry u r great

Really like kind of my least favourite app in my life right about now. Not the best user UX workflow especially moving between promo verification and checkout.

How about you sort that right out?,really like kind least app life right not best user especially moving verification able deliver right as want money how sort right

If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered food and the delivery time kept getting pushed back and it would have been over a hour later when my food would have been delivered.

I canceled because they couldn't find someone to deliver in a timely manner and I had to pay the cost.,if i could give zero i would i ordered food delivery time kept getting back would hour later food would when i i fee i could find someone deliver timely manner i pay cost

I cancelled my order because the restaurant didnt have all the items but Uner eats didnt returned my $40 to my credi card. I contacted them next day to ask and they said it would be 10 days  a month later i followed up and they tell me i never comctacted them and it's too late. I did  but i shouldn't have had to in the first place  if the order was cancelled just refund me. Basically they just took my $40. Seriously how can you just keep my money?!,i order restaurant didnt eats didnt returned card i next day ask said would days month later tell never late i first place order refund basically took seriously keep money

Works fine for the purpose. Not 5 stars because there are stuff that should be automated and shown to the user. For example if a courier is not available  after a period of time we should be able to cancel the order for a full refund in the app  instead of contacting the customer service.,works fine purpose not stuff shown user for example courier available period time able cancel order full refund app instead customer service

شكرا ل خدمتكم جميله,
The app is not very easy to use sometimes it is frustrating and difficult and lags a little The selection of restaurants is good but it needs to add more restaurants that are found on other food ordering applications,the app easy use sometimes difficult little the selection good needs add found food
I made my order I waited over an hour tried to cancel my order was unable to cancel my order when the pick up the order the map showed that he had not moved in over 5 minutes he had left the parking lot when I called the driver he asked which order I was and I told I had to leave the place I was at and didn't have time to wait any longer and that was at an hour and 45 minutes so I never received my food and ended up paying $15 for nothing,i made order i hour tried cancel order unable cancel order pick order map left parking lot i driver order i i told i leave place i time wait longer hour i never received food ended paying nothing

Been using this app for well over 3 years and some restaurants literally get the wrong order EVERYTIME and it turns into ab argument about who's to blame the restaurant or uber eats which is NONE of the clients concern  no matter how many complaints filed I haven't received a single call from Uber Eats  that itself says it all.,been app well literally get wrong order turns argument blame restaurant eats none concern matter many i received single call eats
Dodgy setup - allows the delivery person to just mark the order as completed without actually delivering. This does 3 things: prevents the customer from being able to contact the delivery person  prevents the restaurant from being able to contact the delivery person (called them)  and takes your money yet you are left with no food and only the ability to leave the driver a bad rating and open a support ticket. Easy to get scammed. Would suggest sticking with deliveroo. *edit - uber refunded,dodgy setup delivery person mark order without actually this customer able contact delivery person restaurant able contact delivery person money yet left food ability leave driver bad rating open support ticket easy get would suggest sticking edit

I hate that your company is not customer friendly. I had an issue with an order & I looked all over the app & could not find a phone number so I can call and talk to someone. Call me traditional but I like to actually speak to a person and not have to message your company. I accidently tipped the terrible driver & had no way of reversing the transaction. You need to put a customer service department in place! If other large corporations put one in place then you all should be able to as well.,i hate company customer friendly i issue order i app could find phone number i call talk someone call traditional i like actually speak person message company i accidently tipped terrible driver way reversing transaction you need put customer service department place if large put one place able well

I wish there was a zero star option. Terrible  terrible interface that hides critical information about the location of a restaurant. Edit: I ordered pickup from a restaurant but the app by default doesn't show the complete address. It had the word Midtown... and hid the rest of the restaurant name. Turns out there's another restaurant in Midtown with the same name. Had to go to the other side of town to pick up what should've been just a few blocks away,i wish zero star option terrible terrible interface critical information location restaurant edit i ordered pickup restaurant app default show complete address it word rest restaurant name turns another restaurant name had go side town pick away

Stay away. App has bugs (didn't apply my coupons for example) and on my first purchase the order came completely wrong. Not sure if restaurant or Uber fault  but in any case Uber tried to compensate with a 5$ discount (the food I paid for was worth more than that)  even though I sent pictures of the wrong order as per request. I'd call it awful service and felt pretty scammed. Don't take me wrong  I'm a regular user of Uber  but Uber Eats does have a pretty bad consumer service and app ain't great. I'll stick to skipthedishes  never had trouble with.,stay away app apply example first purchase order came completely wrong not sure restaurant fault case tried compensate discount food i worth even though i sent wrong order per request i would call awful service felt pretty do take wrong i regular user eats pretty bad consumer service app ai great i stick never trouble

Called to change my address within 5 minutes of placing my order as I was at work and I usually order from home. I was charged the total amount without even a partial refund as the reason was the restaurant started preparing the order. For a customer to pay in full after trying to change the address less than 5 minutes of order is not a fair and good practice. Especially since no order is being delivered. Deleting the app and not using uber again.,change address within order i work i usually order home i total amount without even partial refund reason restaurant order for customer pay full trying change address less order fair good practice especially since order app

Very DISAPPOINTED. Last Saturday I order food. For my kid and I. Got the wrong order which is very common. Not sure why. Anyways the company or restaurant doesnt hesitate to take your money but they have issues refunding your money right away. Feels like I'm the one being punished having to wait nearly a week to get my money back. I believe this company policy shouldn't apply to situations like this. If they mess up they need to give the money back right away. I didn't even eat the wrong order!,very disappointed last i order food for i got wrong order common not sure anyways company restaurant doesnt hesitate take money money right away like i one wait nearly week get money back i believe company policy apply like if mess need give money back right away i even eat wrong order

VERY VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED!! I've ordered from them a couple of times and it's been 2 TIMES that they took 20$ of my debit card and 1 TIME 7$ when I used their 20$ rebaits for INVITING A FRIEND. They have taken 47$ of my account and gave me back 20$. THAT IS MORE THAN UNFAIR. Because I have to pay full price for my food of course but when they=million dollar companie make a mistake THEY DONT DO NOTHING. I'LL BE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE AND MY MONEY  PLEASE. We will see if I get some help.,very very very i ordered couple times times took debit card time i used inviting a friend they taken account gave back that is more than unfair because i pay full price food course million dollar make mistake they dont do nothing i be waiting for a response and my money please we see i get help

Customer service gets 1star they don't properly read your complaints and clearly don't have a good grasp of the English language. I've never seen such a lack of ability to understand basic instructions. I was trying to update a new payment instruction and two staff thought I was trying to change my delivery address! 🤔 4/3/2020 Edit: I ordered a McDonald's and they tried sending three different drivers to collect it  by the time I received my meal it was cold and Uber won't refund the cost.,customer service star properly read clearly good grasp language i never seen lack ability understand basic i trying update new payment instruction two staff thought i trying change delivery address thinking face edit i ordered tried sending three different collect time i received meal cold refund cost

Desrespeitoso com os clientes. Pedi para o endereço errado  mas segui as orientações do aplicativo para resolver a situação. A orientação era ligar para o entregador e dizer o endereço correto. Fiz isso  porém o entregador tava de bike e não pudia ir em casa. Foi ai que me ligaram de SP dizendo que o meu pedido ia ser cancelado e que eu teria pagar o seu valor integral. Eu reclamei dizendo que o aplicativo não falava dessa possibilidade e o suporte disse não importa o que o aplicativo diz 👏👍,os para mas para resolver a era para e de bike e em ai de ser e eu valor integral eu dessa e clapping hands thumbs

First time ordering today. Order was wrong. No response from Uber eats after I immediately notified them on app when I got my food. Sent proof And no response. Bad customer service never got any response. Update: my bank account shows I was charged for the whole food order when I had missing items. App says I was given discount but it's a lie. GrubHub is the best food delivery so far even though you pay more it's not a headache.,first time today order wrong no response eats i immediately notified app i got food sent proof and response bad customer service never got response update bank account i whole food order i missing app i given discount lie best food delivery far even though pay headache

Excellent and quick. I did a little experiment between Uber Eats and Doordash to see which one was more expensive. I compared the same restaurant (Popeyes in this case) and gave a 4$ tip on both apps and found Doordash to be several dollars more with the same items and it has a longer delivery time. Not a jab at Doordash just a comparison. Would highly recommend Uber Eats if you cannot get out of work for lunch.,excellent quick i little experiment eats see one expensive i restaurant case gave tip found several longer delivery time not jab comparison would highly recommend eats get work lunch

Scam alert: Uber eats SA hires thieves who steal our food and when you take it up with Uber they tell you they can't assist you with your issue and that you won't get a refund. My food never arrived and I logged a complaint only for Uber to tell me that I've made a complaint previously and that my activities are suspicious and that my account will be taken down. I took the liberty to do it for them. I deleted my account and I highly recommend for anyone to not waste their time.,scam alert eats sa steal food take tell assist issue get refund my food never i logged complaint tell i made complaint previously suspicious account taken i took liberty i account i highly recommend anyone waste time
App can't locate the exact location  You can't even find your location or set it by yourself. The delivery man don't use internet too. They take your money and don't even give your food.

And they simply dont give you any contact for customer service or other way to try to provide help. you just get locked out! So I simply cant acess and there's no one to help or Log in with social media or anything,terrible i trying install always when i give phone number ask password i dont remember cause i instead say password wrong also wrong and simply dont give contact customer service way try provide help get locked so i simply cant one help log social media anything

Ordered £20 of food from a burger chain  when it turned up over £7 of it was missing. Took over 9 hours to hear back from customer services! Fine that you refunded the missing items but if I wanted to reorder them I'd have to pay another £3.50 delivery. You could easily have rung the shop & got them to send it out there and then. Also getting someone on a bicycle to deliver meals with hot coffee in isn't a good idea is it? Half of mine was soaked into the drinks holder.,ordered food chain turned missing took hear back customer fine missing i reorder i would pay another delivery you could easily rung shop got send also getting someone bicycle deliver hot coffee good idea half mine soaked holder

Expect overpricing. Expect big delays. (Hour and a half after my last order  they just updated the delivery time to another 30 minutes. Can't cancel without paying for nothing.) If these weren't common issues  I'd vent within their customer service. But it has gotten kind of ridiculous.,expect expect big hour half last order delivery time another ca cancel without paying nothing if common i would vent within customer service but gotten kind ridiculous
Attempted to cancel an order to Popeyes immediately due to an incorrect delivery address to a whole different city & state. This fast food was not picked up yet and probably not even prepped either  but Uber Eats will not cancel the transaction. They still charged me for unprepared  untaken  and undelivered goods. Very scam-like! Just horrible! Overseas customer service rep very irritatingly would thank me very much after every statement I made too  which only aggravated the situation.,cancel order immediately due incorrect delivery address whole different city state this fast food picked yet probably even either eats cancel transaction they still unprepared untaken undelivered goods very scam like just horrible overseas customer service rep irritatingly would thank much every statement i made situation
So you make an order  you wait 45 mins  they send it to the wrong person  then Uber calls you to say that the order has to be cancelled  rather than having the restaurant make the meal again and send it. I don't understand. This is Uber service?,so make order wait send wrong person say order rather restaurant make meal send i understand this service

Deleting this app! I've absolutely had it. I picked a restaurant that had a free delivery because it's close by and I'm sharing the delivery with other orders. My meal was 14 dollars. Then they hit me with a a 2 dollar service fee and a 3 dollar small delivery fee. WTH?! I ordered a meal and a soda and soup. Small delivery fee?! After tax and tip and fees my meal was 23 dollars. Ridiculous. Uber is a joke. I'm switching to lyft and door dash!

Totally annoyed. Got an email about free delivery....started to get everyone's order in and by the time I was about to hit enter...it said the deal was over. It was literally a count down. Why would you think anyone would come back or order after that. I went to door dash and ordered. UPDATE ...so you answer me and you obviously did not read my complaint otherwise you would know that I understand how it works but you offered FREE delivery but once I got my order together it said it expired.,totally got free delivery get everyone order time i hit enter said deal it literally count why would think anyone would come back order i went door dash ordered update answer obviously read complaint otherwise would know i understand works free delivery i got order together said

A lot of great restaurants around here within 2 miles that aren't included as options. There definitely needs to be more variety available especially when there are not so great restaurants that are over 4 and 5 miles listed. It just doesn't make sense to me. Also as I'm scrolling through the app I see the same restaurants 2 or 3 times. What's the point of this??...Unfortunately as a result I've been using Door Dash much more although their delivery drivers aren't that great.,a lot great around within included there definitely needs variety available especially great listed it make sense also i app i see times what point unfortunately result i door dash much although delivery great

This app is crazy! I tried to order from MacDonald  I went to checkout & order was no longer available so I went back to menu to order alternative then a message came up saying order is on its way  but that was just the food so went back to menu and ordered the drink  Only thing was the previous order separate drivers one with drinks one with food and no option to cancel the new drink order. So I paid £11 on delivery 🤔😟😠😡 long delay between ordering and confirmation. Uncertainty on orders,this app crazy i tried order i went order longer available i went back menu order alternative message came saying order way food went back menu ordered drink only thing previous order separate one one food option cancel new drink order so i delivery thinking face worried face angry face pouting face long delay confirmation uncertainty

I have removed my UBER EATS app. This is the third time the driver didn't double check to make sure the order was complete! Not worth it! Maybe it will be complete or maybe not! Don't call because no one cares and now I have to scrambled for dinner  which is crazy because I ordered so I didn't have to cook!! *There is nothing more to add!,horrible support i support line totally useless my order missing complete order driver told someone could go get order i get help one i removed eats app this third time driver double check make sure order complete not worth maybe complete maybe do call one i dinner crazy i ordered i cook there nothing add

Pasaron días y se me cobraron de mi tarjeta 14 dólares  y a pesar de enviar fotos y pruebas de que se me realizó el cobro  el soporte de uber solo atinó a responderme el mismo mensaje el cobro no se le ha realizado sin devolverme nada,total no la en el fin de pizza el la un con el mi dinero se de mi de de se el el de solo el el se ha sin

Deliveroo is so much better - at least they don't charge you for food you did not receive. We just ordered  the delivery guys could not be bothered to check our instructions on the message  so they allegedly delivered. No one rang our doorbell  no food made it to us. No way to contact the delivery guys whatsoever to even tell them they got the wrong address. What the hell. They even changed my account already. Never ever ever going to use that again!,much better least charge food receive we ordered delivery could check message allegedly no one rang doorbell food made us no way contact delivery whatsoever even tell got wrong address what hell they even account already never ever ever going use

This is the third time one of my orders has been messed up. When I complained I received a refund of the food but as I said in my response  I would not have ordered food for my guests if I had known that 75% of my order would not come in.

The app will force you to use a credit card just to use a gift card and if you contact customer service about it they blatantly ignore you. I have $25 in uber credits from an uber gift card that the app will not allow me to use without adding a credit card as a payment option. I have no desire to add a credit card just to try out a service I should be able to use with the gift card I already added to my account. When I asked for help they gave me a BS response saying to add a credit card.,the app force use credit card use gift card contact customer service blatantly ignore i gift card app allow use without credit card payment option i desire add credit card try service i able use gift card i already added account when i help gave response saying add credit card

It's ridiculous that you are charged for a mistake and the only way to fix the mistake is to call them and waste time talking to a representative that sounds like a porn star.

Absolutely terrible! So by the time my food arrived it's cold and half of my order is missing. I understand that's not uber's fault. My problem came from trying to get a phone number to discuss my order. It was basically impossible. So I go to the online help center and they CHARGED ME FOR IT. On my 24 dollar order I was only refunded 9 dollars but charged 6 for reaching out to someone. Uninstalled and will never use again.,absolutely terrible so time food cold half order missing i understand fault my problem came trying get phone number discuss order it basically impossible so i go help center me for it on dollar order i reaching someone uninstalled never use

Install Glovo instead. Uber eats has terrible service  very dishonest. The app works terribly bad giving out wrong geolocational information.

Nic,
Awesome experience,awesome experience
Does not work. Can't even enter an address to search,does work ca even enter address search
This app is trash. The deliveries are even more so with incompetent drivers that can't be bothered to do a pretty simple job to its fullest extent. Messing up orders  forgetting drinks/food  not paying actual attention to whatever an order has requested  and delivering a mess of what should have been food and/or drinks. Cancelling  because looking for the correct address is too problematic  not having the initiative to make a call to the customer. Is this not a job to take seriously? GD waste.,this app trash the even incompetent pretty simple job extent messing forgetting food paying actual attention whatever order mess food looking correct address problematic initiative make call customer is job take seriously waste

App always works well. Unfortunately  absolutely terrible customer service. Driver picked up the wrong order from the resturaunt (accident). The driver was apologetic and polite. I spoke to Uber Eats customer support  they refused to call the resturaunt and rectify the issue. Instead  they cancelled my order and said it would take 5 - 10 business days for the money to return to my account. I was told ''there's nothing I can do'   then got hung up on. Took my money  and cancelled my food.,app always works well unfortunately absolutely terrible customer service driver picked wrong order accident the driver apologetic polite i spoke eats customer support call rectify issue instead order said would take business days money return account i told nothing i got hung took money food

The numerous charges are ridiculous. I shouldn't be charged for having a small order or 5 dollars for delivery. I would love to use this app but it's too expensive. I'll have an order of 10 dollars but with all the extra added on fees it's like 15 dollars more. A 10 dollar order turns into a 25 dollar order🙄,the numerous ridiculous i small order delivery i would love use app expensive i order extra added like a dollar order turns dollar order face rolling eyes
Absolute trash. Nothing works. Coupons? Ran out of time even though it's not expired. Card info is wrong for every single card put in. Not declined  just said wrong information? Half the restaurants don't have their full menu so if you have a kid chances are they won't have the kids meals as an option. Every single email said it already had an account and this was my first time trying to use this app. If I could I would give negative stars. It double charged me after I couldn't get my food.,absolute trash nothing works ran time even though card wrong every single card put not declined said wrong information half full menu option every single said already account first time trying use app if i could i would give negative it double i could get food
Amazing 😂,amazing face tears joy
My experience with Uber Eats was terrible their response team was not helpful at all and the restaurants are always getting my orders wrong with no refunds it was great at first but just got worse over time plus this new Rewards program stinks I spent up to Gold status all's I got for it was $5 Uber cash that's an insult just another example of corporate greed I closed my account,my experience eats terrible response team helpful always getting wrong great first got worse time plus new program i spent gold status i got cash insult another example corporate greed i closed account
You give me food. 5/5,you give food
Its an pretty great app  the restaurants could edit their option choice buttons better. Some on them say theres a choice for this or that then when you click on it it doesnt allow you to choose this or that and you get nothing. Also theres a service fee on top of deliver fee and tip usually makes my order 10-20$ more then it should be. Convience is a wicked thing to pay for. 10-20$ is a bit much though.,its pretty great app could edit option choice buttons better some say theres choice click doesnt allow choose get nothing also theres service fee top deliver fee tip usually order wicked thing pay bit much though

I enjoy using this app as it is convenient for when I'm unable to leave or simply dont want to drive to get food. The main issue I have is the inconsistency of restaurant availability. If they're all closed the app wont say that  it will just say uber eats is not in your area. And some time within the last few weeks suddenly all my favorite restaurants are now too far away and there are only like 5-6 available to me now.,i enjoy app convenient i unable leave simply dont want drive get food the main issue i inconsistency restaurant availability if closed app wont say say eats area and time within last suddenly favorite far away like available

This is good for an emergency night for my family when I don't get the chance to cook. But on a $40 meal end up having to pay taxes plus roughly another $15 and delivery fees and service fees. I find that kind of pricey  I wish that the restaurants I usually like ordering from would do delivery themselves  this company is making a killing! Aside from all that  the app is pretty easy to use and there can be a good variety depending on where you live and what's available around your area.,this good emergency night family i get chance cook but meal end pay plus roughly another delivery service i find kind i wish i usually like would delivery company making killing aside app pretty easy use good variety depending live available around area

The app is great overall  easy to use. My only complaint is that; I wish there was a way for the restaurant to not make the order until there is a driver available. Because of this the order is often cold and later than expected. I always assume it will take the longest time +10mins. What can you do? 🤷‍♀️,the app great overall easy use my complaint i wish way restaurant make order driver available because order often cold later i always assume take time mins what woman shrugging

Definitely as of late  having food carriers that are walking when their vehicle method says car or bike is getting too out of hand.

Unfortunately Uber Eats isn't what it was when it started to operate.

Why would it let me order to an address 3 hours away with no warning? It did this twice and both times I had to argue with support to not get charged. The warnings you're supposed to get doesn't always come up  it's a bug in the application.

I lost money and food. I spoke to a consultant and they couldn't redirect the delivery man to deliver it at the requested time.

Not happy with this delivery service  placed an order with a restaurant and the driver was late to pick up order which added 20 mins more for delivery which made the order run over 1hr 20 mins. When drive received order and food was 8 mins away from me  everything was canceled at last minute and I was stuck almost 2 hrs later with no food to take with medication. This was a very bad experience  would have gave them no stars for no food. Worst off there isn't anyone you can call. Very unhappy.,not happy delivery service order restaurant driver late pick order added delivery made order run hr when drive received order food away everything last minute i stuck almost later food take medication this bad experience would gave food worst anyone call very unhappy
If there is an option for giving negative marks i wish to have it. Such a rubbish service from Uber my husband called the driver and explained him for 20 mins and he was at the right location. He started swearing on my husband and saying i am not your servant you have to give accurate location. The location which we have shared with him was dropped pin that is 100%correct. Where is the service is this what Uber calls a service to threat the person??? Such case must be reported to local police,if option giving negative wish such rubbish service husband driver right location he husband saying servant give accurate location the location pin correct where service service threat person such case must local police

I have in black and white you guys admitting you cannot carry out the task your organisation has set up for? Deleted  never again  go scam someone else!,picture it late night you land home order my child receive food rude driver arrival works i eats respond inconvenience saying we sorry guarantee restaurant deliver everything order what i black white carry task set never go scam someone else
Every single time I have ordered my food has been dropped and spilled. Very unhappy with uber Eats.,every single time i ordered food very unhappy eats

Call centre agent is so rude and unwilling to help.,call agent rude unwilling help
أول ما أشتركت معهم كانت الخدمة ممتازة. لكن بالفترة الاخيرة صاروا يعطونوا طلبات خطأ ومرات تكون ناقصة. وخدمة العملاء ما يردون علي بس يقولولي أنه راح نتواصل معك لكن نصابين يسحبون علي وآخر مرة اتهموني بأني كذاب. لكن إن شاء الله لن يتم التعامل معهم مرة آخرى. وهذي كانت تجربتي معهم . أتمنى ما تصير مع أحد غيري,

Metem nojo no apoio e na fraco suporte ao cliente. São inúmeros os casos de engano por parte dos restaurantes e que a uber se desresponsabiliza do sucedido  se há enganos então os custos que sejam creditados a quem se engana  não o consumidor final. Fiz uma encomenda de um jantar para dois  o restaurante assumiu o erro  foi dito para cancelar a reserva que o restaurante iria cobrir a mesma. O que é que a uber faz? Cobra parcialmente  mantém a taxa de entrega e o cliente final sem nada.,e na os de dos e se se os se final de um para para o cobra de e final

I was contacted by an ubereats employee and was told that there was no drivers near my area to get my food at the moment and that I should cancel my order. So I did and I tried to contact customer support to get a refund back and was told they can't help me get my money back so people be careful because they won't help you.,i employee told near area get food moment i cancel order so i i tried contact customer support get refund back told help get money back people careful help

Payment Method - Once you register your's credit card  you can't delete it.

Why are there Uber walkers  the service is so slow and my food gets cold by the time it gets to my place. At least have a bike or something. Also  food orders get mixed up all the time. Couriers should check the items before they just walk out. And customer service is non existent because the company knows how much costs would be incurred if they had real people as customer service rather than just a list of steps that we are already capable of doing. Trash,why service slow food cold time place at least bike something also food get mixed time check walk and customer service non existent company much would real people customer service rather list already capable trash
The app works beautifully  but I have had two bad experiences with Uber drivers stating that I did not pay them when I paid in cash and tipped well on both occasions. I never received contact after reporting my issues and I will sadly not be using them again. I actually deserve an apology for receiving such shoddy service after being a good customer for a very long time. Disappointing.,the app works beautifully i two bad i pay i cash tipped well i never received contact i sadly i actually deserve apology shoddy service good customer long time disappointing

The worst customer service ever! I placed an order and tracked delivery driver right up to the order being picked up only to find it was canceled. Called the restaurant and they said they've handed the order over to the driver. There's no customer service ph number on the app so I found the driver customer service and spoke with Paul who dumped me through to Kim which by the way these names are all made up and said they can't tell me why my order was cancelled!! Hopeless customer service!!,the worst customer service ever i order tracked delivery driver right order picked find restaurant said handed order driver there customer service number app i found driver customer service spoke kim way made said tell order hopeless customer service
Waited 35 minutes for food.. which was canceled randomly... no notice because pop eyes was out of chicken. No credits given for issue. Waited 10 minutes for that notice. I recommend any other good deliver service or just make food. Uber eats is trash,food randomly notice pop chicken no given issue notice i recommend good deliver service make food eats trash
At the beginning I was Like a good fish biting those discount promos  it was good  few months later all of the sudden: promos expiring at 7pm on the exp day  small order fee $2 extra...Rather go fetch the food myself!

Its overly priced instead of having higher delivery fees they put an additional fee on everything.

Since some update or other  whenever I leave the app it deletes my cart. Very frustrating. I'll switch between this and other food delivery apps trying to find something appealing and just when I've decided to go with Uber I discover my carefully planned meal has been deleted and I have to re-enter it all over again. I understand people could potentially mistakenly order something left from days before but at least put a time on it. Almost immediately my cart is deleted.,since update whenever i leave app cart very i switch food delivery trying find something appealing i decided go i discover carefully meal i enter i understand people could potentially mistakenly order something left days least put time almost immediately cart

Terrible. I have all the food delivery apps and UberEats is absolutely the worst. Charged $30 dollars for an accidental cancel. Food was cold. Order wrong. And UberEats hasn't even RESPONDED to any of my complaints and still has not reversed the INSANE $30 dollar fee. Go with: Seamless  GrubHub  PostMates  DoorDash or litterally ANY other service. Had solid results with the others. UberEats is getting un-installed.,terrible i food delivery absolutely worst accidental cancel food cold order wrong and even still reversed insane dollar fee go seamless any service had solid getting un

My app has been very buggy lately. I recently tried to order pizza but the order would not process  so eventually gave up and used my friend's phone to order. Ended up with 3 lots of pizza (most of it unwanted) all of which we paid for - have tried to find a way to report this and to request a refund  but it's incredibly difficult to find any contact info. Now  my app isn't working at all  and gets stuck on the 'add your delivery address' page. Very disappointed.,my app buggy lately i recently tried order pizza order would process eventually gave used friend phone order ended lots pizza unwanted tried find way report request refund incredibly difficult find contact now app working stuck add delivery address page very disappointed

It's not as good as Doordash! 1)There's no bottom to refund a customer right away without calls and wait time.2) they give time  when they don't know how long it'll take to make it. A large pizza in 9 min. No way!!!!! It's 20 min. And many times there's no choice to adjust the time. Neither a bottom to cancel an order for a restaurant. App developers could do better I believe!!!,it good there bottom refund customer right away without wait time give time know long take make a large pizza min no way it min and many times choice adjust time neither bottom cancel order restaurant app could better i believe

The Uber software is horrible! When it works  it's beautiful  smart and well designed. The problem is  I'd guess 40% of time I attempt to place an order I have some issue with the cart  or some new error message. I hate leaving bad reviews but I cant stand uber eats anymore! Scroll down at the recent reviews people  almost ALL BAD. They reply to them all tho tell us more about your issue they should INSTEAD pay ppl to FIX THE PROBLEMS instead of apologizing for them!,the horrible when works beautiful smart well designed the problem i would guess time i attempt place order i issue cart new error message i hate leaving bad i cant stand eats scroll recent people almost all bad they reply tho tell us issue instead pay fix the instead
I paid about 60$ for pho from the Vietnamese restaurant An Chi in San Francisco. When I opened the broth container  a really disgusting smell came out  and almost made me puke  and my friend had the same reaction. There was no way we were gonna eat that  so I threw everything to the trash. After more than a month of back and forth with uber eats  they offered to give me a 5$ coupon. This is a joke  and I'm deleting the app  and will use grubhub instead. Very disappointed and angry at uber eats.,i pho restaurant an chi san when i broth container really disgusting smell came almost made puke friend reaction there way eat i threw everything trash after month back forth eats give coupon this joke i app use instead very disappointed angry eats

Good but  I am tired of having to message my exact location to my delivery guy because the won't let pin point exactly where I am located like the original Uber app does. It would really help if there was an option to do so. Also there are some options missing from certain restaurants. [Edit] I tried adding the new address but now add manually option seems to be there. I'm begining to think it's a regional thing  I live in the Dominican Republic.

Doesn't let you placed orders without a card on file. What's the reason of the option for paying in cash if I am unable to use it? Doesn't makes sense.

Make the order at 210 and am told it will arrive by 320 at the latest........ nope wasnt the case either this stupid app messed up or the lazy people at the pizza place didn't want to make the food but 3 came and all the app kept saying was food was being prepared,got app morning food proceed order pizza place make order told arrive latest nope wasnt case either stupid app lazy people pizza place want make food came app kept saying food prepared

It's been a while since I've ordered with ubereats but there was one place I wanted that they had. I was using the regular Uber app and it says that I chose a restaurant that's only on the ubereats app. Ugh  but fine. But then it's not in the app either. I spent 10 minutes going between both apps and the website to figure it out and nothing. They're not cheaper  so this was the only reason I had for using ubereats at all.,it since i ordered one place i i regular app i chose restaurant app ugh fine but app either i spent going figure nothing they reason i

Everything fine  until we placed an order. Paid  of course  25.5€ total. The courier said he arrived and contacted us. This never happened. We were at home  not a single message on the app neither by phone  no phone calls. The feedback? We cannot do anything  because the courier acted according the policy. I am sure he did not. Not a single check  anything? He said he contacted us. I say he did not. Our money? Gone. Later update: someone offered good support in the end.,everything fine order course total the courier said us this never we home single message app neither phone phone the feedback we anything courier according policy i sure not single check anything he said us i say our money gone later update someone good support end

One of the worst food ordering app and never using it again ! Help option is worst and there is no way to contact with anyone. Plus way to expensive and don't waste your time and money.,one worst food app never help option worst way contact anyone plus way expensive waste time money
It robbed me of my money  charged me more than what I was supposed to pay. Rather use Mr Delivery.,it money i supposed pay rather use delivery
Eventually got the app working. I happy now.,eventually got app working i happy
Very poor user flow for the log in and even poorer customer service. Contacted them because i could not log in to my account. They told me i did not have an account. But my phone number is still linked to account which they can't find because i do not have the email address. So i can not order. And they can not do anything about it.,very poor user flow log even customer service could log account they told account but phone number still linked account find address so order and anything

This app is great for rich people. 32 bucks for 2 burger meals at mcdonalds is just too expensive. They take a percentage of your total price instead of a basic service fee so i wont be using it often. Trash to be honest just walk to your store to save 50 percent of your money.....,this app great rich people expensive they take percentage total price instead basic service fee wont often trash honest walk store save percent money

Update: Same problems even after clearing cache. I cannot order any more.

Very easy to use  convenient,very easy use convenient
App works great but customer service is non existent. There is no customer support if there are issues with the order  you are just sent a message saying sorry for your experience leave a rating for the restaurant so they can possibly improve their service. Uber dont even check that their drivers are who they say they are most of the time it will be a completely different person than who they say will deliver and the vehicle doesn't match either. 👎👎👎,app works great customer service non existent there customer support order sent message saying sorry experience leave rating restaurant possibly improve service dont even check say time completely different person say deliver vehicle match either thumbs thumbs thumbs
It was good untill they make a mistake and deny thier mistake and refuse a refund. Just go to zomato,it good untill make mistake deny mistake refuse refund just go
Sometimes works  sometimes let's me put everything in my basket then says sorry your too far away when I've not moved! Sort it out! It's annoying and dumb as hell. I live in a city this shouldn't be a problem.,sometimes works sometimes let put everything basket sorry far away i sort it annoying dumb hell i live city problem
Very easy app to use,very easy app use
This app is honestly the worst at resolving issues. Why does it not promo me to confirm my address? Why do I get phone calls from drivers asking me to solve a problem implicit in the app functionality? Why does this app glitch out and then refuse to admit. Even worse is that these poor drivers are beholden to no support or assistance at all from Uber. Sort your selves out Uber. You HAVE to be better than this.,this app honestly worst why confirm address why i get phone solve problem implicit app functionality why app refuse admit even worse poor beholden support assistance sort you have better

Latest update. If ordering from McDonald's don't expect your orders to be complete. Chicken Selects for instance come as part of the menu with two dips worth £1.00. Didn't get them for the second time of ordering and Uber weren't helpful at all. Had fries/burgers and fruit bags missing from orders too but what do I expect from big companies? A good service?! Yeah right!!!,latest update if expect complete chicken instance come part menu two worth did get second time helpful had fruit missing i expect big a good service yeah right

This continues to be the worst possible way to order food. Always late and a gamble if all items will be included. Often wrong items are delivered when support is contacted it takes several hours or days to receive a response which is usually copied and at best tenuously connected to the issue at hand. Actually the best way to ensure your ordering experience is as poor as possible!! Avoid at all costs and go directly to the restaurant for a better experience,this worst possible way order food always late gamble included often wrong support several days receive response usually copied best tenuously connected issue hand actually best way ensure experience poor possible avoid go directly restaurant better experience

Need to have a better hiring system some drivers dnt match their picture,need better system match picture
To my complaint below  Uber responded only to the missing food (the part of the problem that was not completely the company's fault  so enabling a driver to be penalised) but no comment about their app changing my order or calling out two different drivers for the same order  or deceptively calling it a past order to sidestep responsibility (the issues that the company cannot pass on to a driver). They'll happily admit someone else's fault (and charge a driver on low-income) but not their own,to complaint missing food part problem completely company fault driver comment app order calling two different order deceptively calling past order responsibility company pass driver they happily admit someone else fault charge driver low income

Bangin' when it works? But I don't understand why the same restaurant is too far away sometimes. I also don't understand why you'd let me make an order then tell me when I go to place it that the place is too far away?? I don't like that it's really inconsistent. There's also not a lot of choice. All just burger joints.,works but i understand restaurant far away sometimes i also understand would let make order tell i go place place far away i like really inconsistent there also lot choice all

Quit some flaws with positioning. Would be good if one could manually place the pin. Initially I rated 3 Stars but upon Uber Eats response I changed to 1 Star. How arrogant?!. Clear your Cache and see if it fixes it. NO UBER EATS. You fix the app. If i have to clean the cache everytime before I am using an app  I'd be doing nothing else than that. You provide the opportunity to do manual adjustments amd it's all fine. It's already possible on the Uber Ride share app. Just do it !,quit would good one could manually place pin initially i rated upon eats response i star how arrogant clear cache see no eats you fix app if clean cache i app i would nothing else you provide opportunity manual fine it already possible ride share app just

Think Ive finally used Uber Eats for the last time. Its got a cool idea of free delivery or something where you can order some options recently ordered and delivery is free but thats nothing compaired to the bill.. for a while I was just impulsive and placed the order and forgot  but after looking at the receipts  and matching to skip the dishes or others  they have a paragraph of fees. Not literally but 5 or 6 lines  hst  fee  delivery fee $12 or more usually. It looks disgusting and messy.,think finally used eats last time its got cool idea free delivery something order recently ordered delivery free thats nothing bill i impulsive order forgot looking receipts matching skip paragraph not literally fee delivery fee usually it disgusting messy

El envío es decente  no tiene nada de especial pero si el restaurante tarda mucho la entrega se pospone indefinidamente  respecto a reparto todo es para con el repartidor  por lo que si tiene algún inconveniente y no puede entregar la comida te quedas sin la misma. Reembolsos tardan 2-10 días contrario a la competencia que es en el momento. Deja mucho que desear,el es de especial si el la se es para con el lo si la te sin la la es en el

This app is great i tried it for the first time today and didn't have any issues logging in loading or placing my order.

The worst food delivery experience I have ever experienced from any product around the world. Our driver went to the wrong address  corrected us on where we lived  and wouldn't deliver our food.

I d rather walk on glass barefoot 10 miles to pick up my food than to ever download this ripoff app. If you're lucky enough to afford their ridiculous fees they'll either mess up the order  the driver eats your fries  or they bring cold food. If you cancel before they start to prepare it  uber cheats claims you wont be charged. Lied. When you call to complain  they admit that the order was canceled quickly n they will reimburse the $32 within 5 days max. Another lie. Received $0 in 10 days,i rather walk glass barefoot pick food ever app if lucky enough afford ridiculous either mess order driver eats bring cold food if cancel start prepare wont lied when call complain admit order quickly n reimburse within days another lie received days

App is user friendly  however uber recently raised all of their additional charges so considering using other services,app user friendly however recently raised additional considering
Buyer beware their address detection is by far the most outdated thing there is. And if the driver waits for you at a wrong address by applications design he can choose to call the delivery as complete and waltz off with your order leaving without your hard earned money or food to eat. I had to explain to every single driver how to get to the destination on multiple ocasions because the app simply doesn't work like the original Uber app. Such a disappointment.,buyer beware address detection far outdated thing and driver wrong address design choose call delivery complete waltz order leaving without hard money food eat i explain every single driver get destination multiple app simply work like original app such disappointment

I have used this app three times to deliver food to my 93 year old mother at the nursing home and it has been a massive headache every time. It would be easier to drive out order the food and wait for it to be prepared and then drive it to my mother than to do this. If a restaurant has two locations the app always defaults to the wrong restaurant. She is in a nursing home that is well known but the drivers always get lost. What a mess. Just uninstalled the app and will try a competitor now.,i used app three times deliver food year old mother nursing home massive headache every time it would easier drive order food wait prepared drive mother if restaurant two app always wrong restaurant she nursing home well known always get lost what mess just uninstalled app try competitor

Ordered an order and after 10 min   they cancelled it with no reason. After a month a made a new order   and i surprised that they want me to pay the amount of the cancelled order receipt  claiming that they can't refund me this amount as the order was made more than 10 days ago.

Sick of late orders. Don't tell me delivery will be in 20-30 minutes  then on the confirmation page say the latest delivery time will be 45 minutes later  and give me no possibility to contact anyone or cancel the order.

Twice in a row now orders have arrived with items missing. 3 items today and cold items today and other days. Wanted the missing items delivered but only given the option of refund. I don't want to order again because it will amount to £7 delivery + tip which I always give. Uber's response  call the restaurant after you order. So  what is the point of using Uber if I have to call the restaurant afterwards anyway? Uninstalling now and will stick to Just Eat or direct ordering 😤,twice row missing today cold today days missing given option refund i want order amount delivery tip i always give response call restaurant order so point i call restaurant afterwards anyway stick just eat direct face steam nose

Our household ordered with Ubereats three times  was a totally frustrating experience twice. Ordered with deliveroo many times and never had a similar issue. Most outrageous: had to pick up our order ourselves because ubereats delivered only half the order. Wrote a complaint email  never heard back. After following up we were told that they can't do anything about it because more than 10 days had passed.

Too bad its just too complicated to view and edit orders if needed. ok  here's the feedback: after placing the order  it's just impossible to edit. I needed to change local of delivery...forget it. Also I needed to add more items (from the same place i was ordering from)...forget it. I tried this imediatly after placing the order so the guys at the restaurant could perfectly modify the order. Also: why I tried to change the delivery local? because the uber gps can't get my address location right. I would be so simple to correct it...it's only 20 meters after all...,too bad complicated view edit feedback order impossible edit i change local delivery forget also i add place forget i tried order restaurant could perfectly modify order also i tried change delivery local get address location right i would simple correct

I fixed that also. But now I sent a delivery to a friend & she left the house as driver arrived  so bad timing  however  long story short  instead of him cancelling order  status said order Delivered and charged me £42 for an order that wasn't delivered.This is falsified information uber refuse to comply,i enjoying service last year recently i restaurant miss food times fixed another example sent porridge take away cup stale bland i fixed also but i sent delivery friend left house driver bad timing however long story short instead order status said order order this information refuse comply

Answer to your response..no  there's nothing you can do I'm too scared to order through uber eats now!!,no way contact driver it delivery service it sense you call customer service contact driver i dont understand wouldnt way contact driver personally my driver went next door accident i could contact late customer service he would answer answer response nothing i order eats

Too many service fees and delivery fees. all these extra fees with taxes is all too much  especially if the driver isn't seeing a penny of it; because they still expect to see a tip. The $10 meal turns into $30.,too many service delivery extra much especially driver seeing penny still expect see tip the meal turns

They like to blame the user if meals turn up incorrectly too many times if the order is wrong or they give you someone else's order and you complain they then suspend your account saying you request too many refunds. Over all the years I have used the app I have 4 orders over a 2 month period turn up missing items or a drink turn up with no lid even after providing photos apparently it was me wrong not the supplier. Cheers uber for reminding me to rate the app I can no longer use :),they like blame user turn incorrectly many times order wrong give someone else order complain suspend account saying request many over i used app i month period turn missing drink turn lid even providing apparently wrong supplier rate app i longer use

Better hope there is not a mistake (made by uber incidentally ) because they charge you first when they shouldnt and there is nobody to contact to get it fixed. No one or way to contact.

So just be patient they are committed to making there customers happy.,better hope mistake made incidentally charge first shouldnt nobody contact get fixed no one way contact i patient money debate they totally fixed its bummer way directly contact so patient making happy
Overpricing  I understand delivery fee But ubereats wanted to charged me a delivery fee for each pizza I wanted 5 simple cheese pizzas  From a Domino's 3 kilometres away. The pizzas were on special 4 dollars each  that would of been $20 for 5 pizzas pick up $30 by Domino's instore delivery service. What did Ubereats want? $15 per pizza plus an $8 delivery fee. For a total of $83 for 5 cheese pizzas from Domino's. Whoever accepts that sort of highway robber needs their head checked.,i understand delivery fee but delivery fee pizza i simple cheese from domino away the special would pick domino delivery service what want per pizza plus delivery fee for total cheese domino whoever sort highway robber needs head checked

I think you should add Wendy's on here. Grubbing takes 4 hour to bring the food and when the food gets to us it's either cold as ice or something is missing.

MY REVIEW WAS DELETED Terrible. Ordered food  have the order came and the driver didn't speak any English so couldn't understand. He grabbed the bag out of my hand and left. As soon as he left this app said the order was complete. The app has customer support which does nothing. Googled a phone number  waited online for 20mins went through all the details and he goes  well your order is complete so I cant help. Just robots  so unprofessional. Do not use!!!!

Here's a fair idea. If a restaurant takes more than 30 mins to deliver you should be shown a button that allows you to cancel. I think that's pretty fair. At the moment the app is in favour of the restaurants  they can take 3 hours and the app still tells you to wait or go through complicated options to report your mistreatment.,here fair idea if restaurant deliver shown button cancel i think pretty fair at moment app take app still wait go complicated report mistreatment

An absolute con! All restaurants have marked up their prices  and Uber charge an extortionate amount on fees on top of that  and delivery costs are far too high. They also have no grip on their drivers  as they're all apparently cycle to my address using cars  which means they aren't paying business insurance on the road.,an absolute con all marked charge extortionate amount top delivery far high they also grip apparently cycle address paying business insurance road

My delivery driver stole my food! He had just picked it up from the takeaway and started riding off in the wrong direction. I didn't get charged but Uber has no way of reporting a delivery driver. If you try to complain Uber will say it's fine because you were not charged. I've now being waiting 2x as long for my order and the takeaway have lost money from the wasted order.

Made an order Sept 19 in Canada which never turned up. I got a refund and life went on. 5 months later  they have charged me for it again. I emailed a complaint only for them to tell me they won't refund me because the order is too old and I should have emailed them earlier. I am absolutely livid.,made order sept canada never turned i got refund life went later i complaint tell refund order old i i absolutely livid

I'm DONE using this service! The drivers keep making other deliveries en route to my house so my food is always cold. And now I did not receive all the products I paid for.

Great app. The order notes for items in certain menus dont always show up when they should it's great for when restaurants aren't consistent with certain items or when something isnt listed when it should be. I've had quite the experience with forgotten items recently it would be nice if order notes would stay consistent for all items regardless of actual necessity cause sometimes I just dont order because the same order has been messed up so many times,great app the order certain dont always show great consistent certain something listed i quite experience forgotten recently would nice order would stay consistent regardless actual necessity cause sometimes i dont order order many times

What's the point of asking customers rate and write reviews on restaurants if WE as customers can't see each other's reviews? If a restaurant sells bad wings  we deserve to know so that we don't waste our money on them! Why hide reviews? Are url on the customer's side or what? Annoyed! Also  outline restaurants' operational times. And make it compulsory that restaurants upload images of the food on the menu! Most of us are reluctant to try food we can't see on the menu.,what point rate write we see if restaurant bad deserve know waste money why hide are customer side also outline operational times and make compulsory food menu most us reluctant try food see menu

I called straight away to get the time amended as it had gone through incorrectly to be told that the restaurant had already prepared (this was within 1 min of placing order) and that I would be charged either way and to basically get someone to my house to collect. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!,i disappointed app service i order delivery pm soon order i received message saying way i straight away get time gone incorrectly told restaurant already prepared within min order i would either way basically get someone house collect not at all

It always says there is a problem with the card I use. Funny because they have no problem with Uber rides. Also if I put an item from the restaurant in my cart and then change my mind there is no place to delete it. I have tried all the obvious ways but it doesn't work for me. I can even go back in the app later and it's still in there. So my son has to order from his app and yes he did try to delete it from my app to no avail. Reply. . I havr done what you said to do and still no resolve,it always problem card i use funny problem also i put item restaurant cart change mind place delete i tried obvious ways work i even go back app later still so son order app yes try delete app avail reply i done said still resolve

Stagnation will eventually lead to its downfall.,still option sign app get message saying already registered thats no option use seriously stupid app i said year ago still fix basic issue many also complain fine money stagnation eventually lead downfall

+15 minutes to our delivery time as while our delivery was on its way it was in fact heading away from us while the driver made another delivery first. Yeah good. Love some cold food. Why does Uber eats allow this to happen? Edit: same thing happened again today. The food isn't the problem  it's not that it's unacceptable. It's the app allowing people on bicycles to make 2 deliveries that are km apart that is unacceptable. Stop passing the buck to the restaurants.

Uber needs to screen their food delivery people as hard as they screen their drivers. The delivery chick literally act like she delivered my food and stole it! I made a complaint and received a refund but they need to stop giving gutter thief rats jobs and give the positions to honest people.

They exploit us fat lazy Americans.,the service terrible food always old gross they bait switch promising min delivery times always end hour lousy every time without fail they exploit us fat lazy
I had high hopes for this app. The app functions pretty well but honestly I think theres just too many moving parts for it to work every time. About 80% of our orders have incorrect or missing items which isnt a huge deal because they can refund you for whatever was messed up or missing  it just sucks when you wait an hour and your order is cancelled so you just end up going out and getting the food yourself instead. XD,i high app the app pretty well honestly i think theres many moving work every time about incorrect missing huge deal refund whatever missing wait hour order end going getting food instead

Then he somehow marks the order as delivered  and the company with the call center in India  oh we will just refund your money  you will get it in 3 to 5 business days. This is a small property! I've had a Postmate driver deliver to the side of the interstate 15 without an address  at a state line!!! This describes the competency level of the Uber Eats drivers!!!

Started our great but lately it's a waiting game. The last several times I have waited so long that by the time my food gets here it's cold because there are no drivers available.

This is my first experience with uber eats and I am highly upset. My driver made it to the restaurant but after that  he dissapeared off the tracker. My delivery was pushed back another 20 minutes. That's ok with me. It has been 10+ minutes and uber eats has still not found a driver. Found driver. Arrived at store. Order cancelled 1 hour after the first arrival time. Only way I got a refund was because I did not get the food after 1+ hour wait after arrival time..Never again will I try uber eat,this first experience eats i highly upset my driver made restaurant tracker my delivery back another that it eats still found driver found driver store order hour first arrival time only way i got refund i get food hour wait arrival time never i try eat

I ordered Uber Eats with my friends during school. In total we spent over 100 dollars on our order. We waited over 1 hour to receive our food. When the driver called he had an attitude and also yelled at me over the phone. We then called him multiple times because we had been waiting for so long for our food. He didn't answer the phone and I ended up having to call customer service and receive a refund and I stayed hungry. I highly recommend that you don't use Uber Eats to order food.,i ordered eats school in total spent order we hour receive food when driver attitude also phone we multiple times waiting long food he answer phone i ended call customer service receive refund i stayed hungry i highly recommend use eats order food

Started strong in December now I work 12 hours and get maybe 8 orders with a 98% rating and never cancellation on anyone's orders.

I've been working 20 to 30 hours a week on this app and making less than 250 to less than 370 cash before taxes. You cannot work Uber full-time in Seattle area.

Uber is HORRIBLE!! Everyone I recommend Favor. It took Uber one hour and thirty seven minutes to deliver my food. This was the second time it happened. I should have learned my lesson the first time. Also with Favor your first delivery is free and no delivery fee for 30 days. I wish I could get my money back. So upsetting. I hardly use Uber but i was running behind schedule and had a meeting to attend so I knew I wouldn't have time to stop.

Disgraceful is an understatement. A glitch in the app didn't allow me to complete my order  and so I made other plans but then got a notification over an hour later that my food had arrived. I told the vendor to notify Uber that there was an issue. Why would I pay for something that isn't my fault? I immediately get bombarded by 'customer service' whose only concern was that I pay up immediately. Not one question about the experience or issue. Was it a prank? Shocking really.,disgraceful understatement a app allow complete order i made got notification hour later food i told vendor notify issue why would i pay something fault i immediately get customer service whose concern i pay immediately not one question experience issue was prank shocking really

Worst experience from a food delivery service. I have been charged several times as a Pending charge even though I haven't used the app on or before the charged dates. Contacted the bank and they confirmed the charged has been made to Uber. Called hotline several times and while waiting for agent the call got disconnected 3 times. Finally contacted an agent and she says they don't know about anything of the mentioned charge. Very unprofessional service from the Agent. No support whatsoever.,worst experience food delivery service i several times pending charge even though i used app bank confirmed made several times waiting agent call got disconnected times finally agent know anything charge very unprofessional service agent no support whatsoever

The person that responded to my complaint said the driver said he called my phone when I received no missed calls  suggested I leave more specific delivery instructions when my instructions could literally not have been more detailed and specific. I am so angry I am going to take this matter to the consumer ombudsman,absolutely terrible tonight i ordered food never i the person complaint said driver said phone i received i leave specific delivery could literally detailed specific i angry i going take matter consumer ombudsman

Generally great  what bothers me is the incoherence on ordering at restaurants in the same area. For instance there is a Zambrero and Maccas at the same shop area(literally they're across the street from each other) but I can never order from Maccas even though the delivery location is the same. Please UberEats work on that so not only me but others can access more restaurant options.,generally great incoherence area for instance shop area literally across street i never order even though delivery location please work access restaurant
My favourite restaurant is OUT OF RANGE and has never come back into my range for weeks. I havent moved and its only the next suburb. contacted the restaurant and they are getting orders. Contacted Uber and were no help making it work again. Dissapointed!,my restaurant out of range never come back range i havent next suburb restaurant getting help making work
It doesnt double check on the placement of orders and I placed one accidentally. But canceled it within 3 seconds..still havent got the $17 refund. How can a restaurant start preparing for an order which was still being processed by the app itself. I could see the green thing buffering. Thats shady. I wonder how much Uber Eats steals money through accidental orders?!!,it doesnt double check placement i one accidentally but within still havent got refund how restaurant start order still app i could see green thing thats shady i wonder much eats money accidental

All these delivery apps suck now they want to charge you a service fee on top of a delivery fee and if you order something under $20 the what to charge you a small order fee so a $10 order will cost you $15+ dollars. And then they want you to tip yeah I could have tip them with the extra $5 you asking for them if a tip they say they are not getting the tips....smh ridiculous,all delivery suck want charge service fee top delivery fee order something charge small order fee order cost and want tip yeah i could tip extra tip say getting ridiculous
I have been using uber eats for a while  everytime i order the delivery partners i get are very unprofessional not to mention that alot of times they dont match their picture and dont even speak english. this happens too often than i can report and its not even compensated by a good service. I haven't eaten in like 20 hours and my uber delivery partner decided that it was better to put the order status as delivered instead of actually delivering the food. Its 5am tho so i guess ill just sleep!,i eats order delivery get unprofessional mention times dont match picture dont even speak often report even good service i eaten like delivery partner decided better put order status instead actually food its tho guess ill sleep
Good selection and easy to use. Would be 5 stars if more restaurants were available.,good selection easy use would available
Availability and menu selection = 4 Customer service = 1 Therefore  the rating averages out to 2.5 For a while this app seemed to monopolize the food delivery industry  after perfecting what JustEat was already doing. Now it faces numerous competitors  which makes me curious to why the customer service lacks so much. After a few bad interactions  I deleted the app.,availability menu selection customer service therefore rating for app monopolize food delivery industry perfecting already now numerous curious customer service much after bad i app

Orders are pretty quick but the restuarants need to be more on point with accuracy especially given specific ordering directions. It's very inaccurate with the consistently missing items in orders that ultimately you can't do much about at the moment you receive your order....but especially for amount of money spent they need to provide better customer service( I have a big family to please) so anything left out could effectively ruin a whole meal....its very frustrating,pretty quick need point accuracy especially given specific it inaccurate consistently missing ultimately much moment receive order especially amount money spent need provide better customer service i big family please anything left could effectively ruin whole meal

I have seen way too many times  my order being accepted by a driver that is way too far away.

Its aggravating.,i seen way many times order accepted driver way far away eventually assigned another driver order take becomes long delivery food comes cold please fix issue its aggravating
Had an incorrect order a few months ago and all i got back was the $3 of the incorrect portion of the meal. When you get a part of the meal wrong  the whole meal is ruined. I don't want $3 for the part of the meal that was forgotten. I want a full refund because my whole meal was ruined without a certain portion. Terrible service. Haven't ordered with them since,had incorrect order ago got back incorrect portion meal when get part meal wrong whole meal ruined i want part meal forgotten i want full refund whole meal ruined without certain portion terrible service have ordered since
Uber Eats has a great variety of options and the food arrives in a reasonable amount of time.,eats great variety food reasonable amount time
They hiked up the delivery prices. Exponentially. My $12 order rounds up to near $21 after a service fee a delivery fee and a Small order Fee that's and additional $3 if yournotser is under $15. And then after you pay this absorbent amount of money  you end up getting an order that isnt even right in the end.,they delivery exponentially my order near service fee delivery fee small order fee additional and pay absorbent amount money end getting order even right end

This has to be the WORST delivery app in Australia. Their customer service is useless and their riders dont have a clue of what they are doing. Cant even make a delivery when the restaurant is 5 mins away from the place of delivery. Surely the drivers do this on purpose so they can get your order for themselves. Useless  use MenuLog or Deliveroo.,this worst delivery app their customer service useless dont clue cant even make delivery restaurant away place delivery surely purpose get order useless use

The orders are great but they claim that there is a hold and take out the tip twice  this has happened to me twice. If this continues I will not give a tip on the app but in cash to driver.

I ordered from a major chain restaurant (red Robin) and their signature whiskey River BBQ burger came without BBQ sauce. It's in the friggin name! They made me pick every single ingredient like I was a friggin subway. Apparently I missed the BBQ option. Make a standard option  seriously. This was the last one  there are now officially no good food delivery companies out there. Order local  folks  have them deliver locally.

I called Uber Eats  they stated  they will refund me for the 1st charge but will not refund me for the second because it's on it's way! I explained that I had to be to work at 11:30am and I had ordered the food around 9am and ETA was Noon.

After Uber eats merged with Zomato  the trust with Uber cannot be build again. Zomato cheats it's customers  so switched over to Uber Eats. Now with no options left relying on other options. ☹️☹️☹️,after eats trust build switched eats now left frowning face frowning face frowning face

The app wont even work now  doesnt let me enter my address and only shows this page asking for a new address for delivery when I restart the app. It wont let me search for my address even when I put it in. It's useless if it's so expensive and is always breaking. I have no way of getting lunch for me and my kids today.,the app wont even work doesnt let enter address page new address delivery i restart app it wont let search address even i put it useless expensive always breaking i way getting lunch today

If you use this app prepare yourself for great disappointments. My orders have been cancelled multiple times after waiting for close to two hours. The order sometimes is delivered with missing items and you are required to pay the full amount inclusive of the missing item. Low grade customer service. Keep off if you are serious about ordering timely meal deliveries!,if use app prepare great my multiple times waiting close two the order sometimes missing pay full amount inclusive missing item low grade customer service keep serious timely meal

I've used UberEats 3 times  two of those were missing an item and their response is to tell me I'm lying so they can't work with the restaurant to see why this happened. There must be a better mechanism for validating orders before delivering the food. This seems like a fundamental part of this service which is missing. EDIT: I reached out after the dev reply only to have them again tell me they can't do anything. If they could get my order right it wouldn't be an issue!,i used times two missing item response tell i lying work restaurant see there must better mechanism food this like fundamental part service missing edit i dev reply tell anything if could get order right would issue

The problem with using this is once you add the delivery fee  service fee then tip you have easily just added an additional 10.00 to your total which is not always worth it. But otherwise if you dont mind paying more for your food its very convenient especially if you are sick or busy this can be very helpful.,the problem add delivery fee service fee tip easily added additional total always worth but otherwise dont mind paying food convenient especially sick busy helpful

This is no reflection on the incredible app  but instead on the more than inadequate customer support after a positively ridiculous experience. We ordered 2x smoothie bowls from kauai on the app. They arrived upside down  and 90% of the contents spilled in the paper bag. The driver left without comment. On informing UberEats - including pictures - they refunded us for only one saying - and I quote We know that you’re not happy with how your dish looks  however we also understand that giving you a credit doesn’t prevent this from happening again. What?!! There are no words.,this reflection incredible app instead inadequate customer support positively ridiculous experience we ordered x bowls app they upside contents paper bag the driver left without comment on us one saying i quote we know happy dish however also understand giving credit prevent happening what there

Getting board of all these technical problems we get it  you're a tech company so all the problems are technical  maybe try to fix them? Get ready for orders not being collected  cancellations  promotions that they email to you not working  a whole load of wasted time then to top it off absolutely awful customer support  they won't talk to you unless it's a active order  the faq and email support is pointless  they just don't help you  it's designed to make you give up.

Forces you to give them all your personal details before even telling you if the service is in your area. Then it tells you that you can't use their service as your house is about 5cm outside their stupid zoning rules. It's like the inventor of gerrymandering set this up. There's tonnes of Uber eats people running around in our town I'm sure they would be happy to take a few steps further to cover the whole town instead of just the few houses that happen to be inside this apps weird shaped zone,give personal even telling service area then use service house cm outside stupid zoning it like inventor set there eats people running around town i sure would happy take cover whole town instead happen inside weird shaped zone

The app itself isn't too bad but the service is terrible. 2 Drivers collected my orders and cancelled at the very end for bogus reasons. They did not even return my food to the restaurant they just made off with it. There is no way to complain on the app because the driver cancelled and the trip was never completed. The option for rating the order only comes up after delivery. I waited 2 and a half hours before the second delivery eventually cancelled and I was still without food.,the app bad service terrible collected end bogus they even return food restaurant made there way complain app driver trip never the option rating order comes delivery i half second delivery eventually i still without food

The only reason it gets a 4 star rating is because uber eats does not deliver to my home location🙁.. so I can only use it when I'm at work... thought it would've changed by now because it's been like that since uber eats came into existence... dont understand why.. because if you can pick up passengers at my location  why can't you deliver food... But other than that I love this app and always use it at work.. please just dont be too extravagant with the extra rands you put on the food,the reason star rating eats deliver home location slightly frowning face i use i work thought would like since eats came existence dont understand pick location deliver food but i love app always use work please dont extravagant extra put food
It's an app that gets you food. That deserves 5 stars 😂,it app food that face tears joy
First order was fine  second order the food was rolling about in the driver's bag opened and soaked in coffee. I refused delivery and the dishonest driver marked as delivered. Contacted support through the app chat and got no answer  phoned customer service and told It can only be dealt with through the app and no resolution given. Very disappointing and will not use uber eats again.,first order fine second order food rolling driver bag soaked coffee i delivery dishonest driver marked support app chat got answer customer service told it dealt app resolution given very disappointing use eats

Horrible first experience. Estimated delivery time was supposed to be 45 minutes. An hour after that and a 2nd driver assigned  still no food and then the order was cancelled. The customer service chat support assured me I would not be charged. No offer to mitigate the 2 hours lost time and irritation of going to bed hungry. No way to contact drivers like you can on GrubHub. Ineffective and non caring customer service department. Dont use this app  there are better options available.,horrible first experience delivery time supposed an hour nd driver assigned still food order the customer service chat support assured i would no offer mitigate lost time irritation going bed hungry no way contact like ineffective non customer service department dont use app better available

Love the app. Only issue I have is the place order button being on the bottom of the screen. Accidentally pushed it when I meant to go back to my home screen so I could order later on.

Going from back to worse all the time  they send a lot of Spam mail with discounts and promos but when you want to use it *you are not eligible for this promo* the delivery is always late and they keep sending you €8 for the delay that you also can't use  missing drinks or food from your order and nobody answers for it  poor customer service  way more expensive than other apps  many fees  so I decided to stop using it  definitely not worth it.,going back worse time send lot mail want use eligible delivery always late keep sending delay also use missing food order nobody poor customer service way expensive many i decided stop definitely worth
Took them 2 hours to deliver food from 3 miles away. They wanted to keep everything but the tip and discount when i tried to cancel. The food never got delivered. After calling customer service they did refund the full amount. Still very unsatisfied with the service. I will use Doordash from now on. The estimated 30 minutes and were early for the delivery.,took deliver food away they keep everything tip discount tried cancel the food never got after calling customer service refund full amount still unsatisfied service i use the early delivery

If you pay for delivery  they make your driver deliver to other people first  anyways. They dont refund mistakes  just say sorry. They dont read your complaints  just auto-respond. They dont compensate your time or care about their customers or drivers at all. They only care about money. Good luck and have fun with this service.,if pay delivery make driver deliver people first anyways they dont refund say sorry they dont read auto respond they dont compensate time care they care money good luck fun service

Price on Uber Eats is higher than ordering direct from store. Not sure if this controlled by Uber or by the food outlet - will retract if it's out of Uber Eat's control. Delivery fee getting close to double figures ($8) for most options. I get you need to make money  but $8 is more than half price of most meals that's on offer. End up calling the store and getting delivery for $5 or less.,price eats higher direct store not sure food outlet retract eat control delivery fee getting close double i get need make money half price offer end calling store getting delivery less

Absolute trash. This is only as good as the drivers and restaurants in you're area. If you live in the hampton roads area of Virginia  dont bother. Drivers dont fallow simple instructions  take the max time to deliver. Resulting in cold food. Then you have the restaurants getting your order wrong with missing major items or just having the order wrong. This happened 3 times in a row. Drove the food back and was refused refund from restuarant and Uber. Even after returning the food.,absolute trash this good area if live area dont bother dont fallow simple take time deliver resulting cold food then getting order wrong missing major order wrong this times row drove food back refund even food
You can spend about $30 on a meal that was ruined by the delivery person but Uber will give you a $5 credit. Oh yeah  and my food was delivered by a person on a BICYCLE who had to cross several lanes of traffic to get to me. And no  you don't get the option to not let someone deliver your food by means of a bicycle. This may be ok in NYC but I live in Tampa  FL.,you spend meal ruined delivery person give credit oh yeah food person bicycle cross several traffic get and get option let someone deliver food bicycle this may i live

Sólo errores y errores. Mi pareja y yo nos descargamos la aplicación para aprovecharnos de los coupones de descuento  pero me imagino a alguien que quiera usarla de manera cotidiana y la desinstalaria por desperación. Está muy mal actualizada  no deja de dar fallos con mensajes tipo el sitio está lejos de la direccion  cuando en realidad te pone eso porque has añadido algo al carro que no está disponible  pero la app no te lo pone  cada vez que tengo que pedir es como hacer un puzzle. Horrible,mi yo la para de de de la mal de dar con el sitio de la en te pone al la app te lo pone es un puzzle horrible

Annoying! I've looked on every article about how to delete payment methods  and they all say to tap the three dot icon to delete payment methods  but no such icon exists and I cannot tap on them to do so. I tried updating the app  thinking that would correct the problem  but that was not the case. Now what?,annoying i every article delete payment say tap three dot icon delete payment icon i tap i tried app thinking would correct problem case now

I'd rather just delete the whole app. They over charge you for everything.

Was working just fine and then today I couldn't order even from a McDonald's that is 0.8 miles away because my location is too far apparently. *in response to uber's reply: I ordered from door dash literally right after and all of the same restaurants that wouldn't let me order on your app were fine on door dash. So your response doesn't make sense.,was working fine today i could order even away location far apparently response reply i ordered door dash literally right would let order app fine door dash so response make sense

Три заказа подряд в течение недели их курьеры просто оставили себе: после получения курьером заказа мгновенно статус сменился на доставлено. ТРИ ПОДРЯД КАРЛ! Поддержка отвечает минимум сутки  максимум доходило до трёх дней. Деньги возвращаются около недели  хотя спасибо  что вообще возвращают. Без каких-либо извинений и компенсаций  естественно. В общем  категорически не рекомендую.,

I placed 2 orders on January 10th  2020 one was placed in error. I immediately notified both the restaurant Suzy's Roti Parlour and Uber. The restaurant acknowledged that they recognized it was a duplicated order and will only send me one order. Which they did. They told me that one of the charges fir the canceled order will drop off my statement  that never happened. As a result I asked my bank to charge back the charge which they did  uber then proceeded to block my use of Uber Car Service,i th one error i immediately notified restaurant the restaurant acknowledged order send one order which they told one fir order drop statement never as result i bank charge back charge block use car service

I don't understand why ubereats is not accessible for me and my certain friends. Whenever I install ubereats it shows and redirect me to download zomato! I mean why though? I was really satisfied with ubereats until this happened! Did you all actually made ubereats inaccessible for us  'Indians' ?,i understand accessible certain whenever i install redirect i mean though i really satisfied did actually made inaccessible us
The app seemed to be malfunctioning and was switching to pick up everytime i set it to delivery. I ended up getting ripped off because of this. No thanks. *after UberEats response-Why didn't customer service mention cache clearing when i asked for a refund? I had a few hundred orders and not one was for pick up. Funny how 1 star rating on your app gets me an answer but not when i politely asked to have the error rectified by customer service.,the app switching pick set delivery i ended getting no thanks response why customer service mention cache clearing refund i hundred one pick funny star rating app answer politely error rectified customer service

Very poor app. Unusable. I'm sure if it worked it would be great. Uninstalled after 5 minutes. *Edit* No way to login. It only asks for an email to register. As we opened an account before (deleted because of app problems) it says email already exists but it doesnt give any option to login. Reading through reviews this seems to be a very common problem. *Edit * Of course you use the same credentials. There is no where to put them though....No login!,very poor app unusable i sure worked would great uninstalled edit no way login it register as account app already doesnt give option login reading common problem edit of course use there put though no login

Interesting that my last review wasen't here when I returned. Can't adjust the tip before ordering. Who tips someone before? Can't cancel after the food is ordered and the time is extended by the restaurant. In my instance from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. Phoned them afterwards and they were unable to cancel the delivery because it was confirmed by the restaurant a joke. Uninstalling. Even going to look into other alternatives for Uber.,interesting last review wase i returned ca adjust tip who someone ca cancel food ordered time extended restaurant in instance afterwards unable cancel delivery confirmed restaurant joke even going look

Has the option to customize your order  unlike similar apps. e.g. more or less salt  or chili  or onions etc. I haven't used the add cutlery option  but for some it's invaluable! Imagine the disappointment! Ive discovered a favourite restaurant  and I can almost always use the free delivery option (nearby restaurants)so that's a bonus. Great for those who cannot get out to shop and cook on occasions. I tend to order a large main to share  and cook some extra veg at home. Great service thank you.,option order unlike similar e g less salt chili i used add cutlery option invaluable imagine disappointment discovered restaurant i almost always use free delivery option nearby bonus great get shop cook i tend order large main share cook extra home great service thank

Not user friendly. Not easy to change address if Google maps is wrong. Your app should conform to Canada Post standards not Google standards. It's obvious Google doesn't check addresses submitted to them  nor are they very quick about fixing their mistakes. I have now reduced my rating to one-star because all you did was passed the buck to some offshore supposed support department that doesn't even understand English. All your rhetoric is absolute BS!,not user friendly not easy change address wrong your app conform canada post it obvious check quick fixing i reduced rating one star buck offshore supposed support department even understand all rhetoric absolute

To: Uber Technologies Inc. There are numerous reasons why I state Eats is the worst food delivery app but the most offensive is your customer service team is unable( or at least stating so) to provide real resolutions to your customers issues/concerns. Feel free to contact me for email communications which serve as an example.,to there numerous i state eats worst food delivery app offensive customer service team unable least provide real feel free contact serve example

I cannot believe a big company like Uber has such a horrible customer service. I placed an order through the app and then about 9 minutes later i canceled it and ordered from other place. I understand that it's been 9 minutes and the restaurant has started getting the order ready  but why in the hell would you put the cancel order option there if you I'M STILL GONNA BE CHARGED FOR MY ORDER EITHER WAY. It doesn't make any f sense. If i know i would be charged either way why would i cancel it???,i believe big company like horrible customer service i order app later ordered place i understand restaurant getting order ready hell would put cancel order option i m still be for my order either way it make f sense if know would either way would cancel

I knew it was something I did not like about Uber eat I just couldn't find out what it was....the problem is don't say free delivery if you spend a certain amount but still charges for delivery.. it's like the free delivery is from the place we ordering from but not from Uber..steal Chargers the same amount for delivery what is the purpose telling us free delivery but it's not free... so when it don't say free delivery I guess y'all charging us for delivery twice,i knew something i like eat i could find problem say free delivery spend certain amount still delivery like free delivery place steal amount delivery purpose telling us free delivery free say free delivery i guess charging us delivery twice

Your app will never be on my phone again  one of your delivery drivers actually called my job and harrassed me. WARNING TO ALL  UBER HIRES VIOLENT AND MENTALLY UNSTABLE PEOPLE  AVOID THEM.

O aplicativo serve pra pedir comida  mas não manda notificação e nem aparece nos pedidos se seu pedido estava em análise do restaurante  ao contrário do Ifood  acabei pedindo outra comida por engano  gastando mais dinheiro  e o aplicativo nem tinha avisado se tinha ou não sido aprovado o outro pedido  agora fiquei com 2 pedidos em andamento. Não recomendo  usem outros aplicativos  talvez só serve por causa do Uber Rewards.,o serve mas e se em dinheiro e se agora em serve

Restaurants seem to care less about quality and getting the order correct because it is UE. It would be really great if the order was checked in front of the carrier  before leaving for delivery. Food quality just seems low at times  special instructions ignored  and I'm missing one or more items often. UE is quick to refund for the items  but it can still ruin the meal - out of frustration or lack of food. With what is charged in fees  UE ought to do everything to insure the orders are correct.,seem care less quality getting order correct it would really great order checked front carrier leaving delivery food quality low times special i missing one often quick refund still ruin meal frustration lack food with ought everything insure correct

Awful. Had wrong food entirely delivered and couldn't get through to anyone for half an hour. The restaurant (McDonalds) said it's all entirely Ubers responsibility.

Terrible! Use at your own risk!! 50% of our order was missing. If you complain then they tell you they will refund your  bank account but in reality they refund your Uber Eats account and you can't do anything with those funds except apply it towards more shotty service from them. Afterwards they say I have a bill with them!! They make promises they do not keep. They don't respond to any follow up emails.,terrible use risk order missing if complain tell refund bank account reality refund eats account anything funds except apply towards shotty service afterwards say i bill they make keep they respond follow

I have an error page in the app and it keeps me stuck on that screen unable to use any other app features so I sent a screenshot of the error page through email and Uber support Twitter and explained the issue and they just keep asking for the same information over and over again.Like an email asking me to send a screenshot of the error page that I already sent twice and when I tried calling over the phone I got transferred and told I should contact a completely different email.Unresolved still,i error page app stuck screen unable use app i sent error page support twitter issue keep information like send error page i already sent twice i tried calling phone i got transferred told i contact completely different unresolved still

Cant even place orders because the $ off promotion offered cant be used at the restaurant location for the order (how do you have an active promotion and when you try to check out you say it cant be used?)  with no way to remove it.

I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 1. As a long-time user  I'm honestly shocked by the poor help support experience I received today. Response to Uber Eats' reply: If the message telling me that my issue had been resolved over an hour after the initial diagnosis chat-bot type message was received (with no interim updates on whether the food was still to arrive)  and still not having the refund reflecting today qualifies as having the issue addressed  then yes the issue is closed.,i review as long time user i honestly poor help support experience i received today response eats reply if message telling issue resolved hour initial diagnosis chat bot type message received interim whether food still arrive still refund reflecting today issue yes issue closed

I honestly love this app so much. Thank you Uber. Much better than all of the other food delivery apps/services. The subscription for $10 a month is actually worth it if you use the app a lot!! I order food with this app at least once every 2 days. My job is strict about leaving to go on a break  so I simply order lunch with Uber Eats. It's honestly perfect and the drivers are always really well trained in a way. Always courteous and on time.,i honestly love app much thank much better food delivery the subscription month actually worth use app lot i order food app least every days my job strict leaving go break i simply order lunch eats it honestly perfect always really well trained way always courteous time

Uber eats is just going down  3 of my last orders were missing something I paid for  and at first they would let me submit a complaint. But the last order mix up  the app would not let me submit my complaint about my missing food  that the restaurant did not give me. Either the driver's need to make sure they have all my food and the restaurant need to do their job and pack my food accurately. I'm disappointed.,eats going last missing something i first would let submit complaint but last order mix app would let submit complaint missing food restaurant give either driver need make sure food restaurant need job pack food accurately i disappointed

I AM DONE WITH UBEREATS. First of all I ordered three different times from the same restaurant and each time they forgot my fries  I even have the photos yet I still haven't gotten a refund. Secondly  Ubereats charged me twice $11.65 when I only had ordered once that day  yet they make it so difficult to receive any help because there is no service number to call  and when I sent an email (this is the exact email I use so I get my receipt and promotions) only response I got was of no help.,i am done with first i ordered three different times restaurant time forgot i even yet i still gotten refund secondly twice i ordered day yet make difficult receive help service number call i sent exact i use i get receipt response i got help

Driver stole half my order. Stay away and use deliveroo Edit: I requested a full refund but was refunded only the items that were missing. Nothing for the delivery and no credit was given. What was the point of me using this app to order food for two  and not being able to even enjoy it? Not to mention the enormous amount of stress and anger this caused. This happens way too often with Uber Eats. There is no help phone line to even tackle these issues.

My first uber account was tied to a phone number I no longer have access to or use. I still have access to the email of that account  however the phone associated with it is old.

I've made other accounts since then but I only recieve discounts on that account. Beyond frustrating.,my first account tied phone number i longer access use i still access account however phone associated old this apparently account unable access meanwhile still consistent account specific i even use i made since i account beyond

LOOK OUT FOR SNEAKY CHARGES EVEN IF DELIVERY IF FREE.... !! Restaurants often make mistakes  what you Order & what you get is Hit & Miss. Uber Customers Service is appalling  an absolute mockery. No one truly speaks English or understands English to be more precise. You are always told to go to the Get Help section on the App which is a contradiction of Terms & has no area of Resolution nine out of ten times. I recommend you use a Competitive Delivery Services  avoid Uber if possible,look out for sneaky even if delivery if free often make order get hit miss service appalling absolute mockery no one truly precise you always told go get help section app contradiction area resolution nine ten times i recommend use competitive delivery avoid possible
The worst of experience!while ordering they wouldn't let me checkout and say network error but magically ends up that i placed my order and comes to my doorstep.oh please get your network glitches fixed!,the worst experience would let say network error magically order comes doorstep oh please get network fixed

My delivery was delayed for two hours and then canceled  when I complained they said they were sorry and told me to make a new order. Not likely,my delivery two i said sorry told make new order not likely
Why all the fees and them you clearly up charge on the food. I understand some of the fees but this is just greedy. I hate uber eats. Your truly a greedy co. Trust me when i say you will not be around for the long haul do to your GREED,why clearly charge food i understand greedy i hate eats your truly greedy trust say around long haul greed
Horrible customer service  they charged me for an order that was canceled before a driver as even assigned to it. They said it was because the place had already started preparing but I called the place  McDonalds. And they don't start prepping until the driver is 3 minutes away so since there was no driver there should have been no charge at all. This coming 3 days off of a driver making me feel unsafe. Uber don't care  even after reaching out to customer support there has been no reply yet.,horrible customer service order driver even assigned they said place already i place and start driver away since driver charge this coming days driver making feel unsafe care even reaching customer support reply yet
I have ordered multiple timed off the app and almost every single time there has been an issue. Either the driver does not bring change or it takes two and a half to three hours to get to me or the delivery partners are rude or its the wrong order. Today I was charged more than I should have been and then they credited me the difference on the account which does not help and it does not really solve the issue of the driver being rude and not able to assist with the issue.,i ordered multiple timed app almost every single time issue either driver bring change two half three get delivery rude wrong order today i i difference account help really solve issue driver rude able assist issue
Lovely polite driver thankyou.,lovely polite driver
Good,good
I was a big fan of uber eats  particularly when there were issues  the service would remedy any mistakes  until my last order. It seemed as though the driver ate half my food. I submitted a complaint to uber but this time the company seemed uninterested to remedy the error. I was told they welcomed my feedback and would look into it. I followed up for some form of remedy  a discount off the next order maybe? Sadly not. Update February 2020 Missing items from order. Poor service from uber eats,i big fan eats particularly service would remedy last order it though driver ate half food i complaint time company uninterested remedy error i told feedback would look i form remedy discount next order maybe sadly update missing order poor service eats
Would be nice to see reviews of the food  so I know what I'm going to get. Also certain delivery riders think it's rude if you don't come to them?

My experience with the app has been great so far. Quick  efficient  bigger choice of restaurants than other apps can offer  and whenever there are any issues with the delivery  the refund has been immediate. I also like the option to tip the driver after the delivery (some other apps offer to tip the driver before the food gets delivered - why would I ever do that),my experience app great far quick efficient bigger choice offer whenever delivery refund immediate i also like option tip driver delivery offer tip driver food would i ever

I enjoy using this app for easy food delivery  but I don't understand why the service fee is necessary and if you have to order $15 worth of food just avoid the small order fee. Also  it would be nice to have a notification like a text message when the food is on the way or has arrived. Sometimes I'll order my food and then get busy doing something and forget to check the tracking on the app. By the time I remember to check  my delivery person has arrived and I have to rush to go get my food.,i enjoy app easy food delivery i understand service fee necessary order worth food avoid small order fee also would nice notification like text message food way sometimes i order food get busy something forget check app by time i remember check delivery person i rush go get food

The app has slightly improved in the past few years  and decently stable. But it tells me that I can update the tip within one hour of ordering  but any change to the tip does not take effect. If anyone from Uber is reading this  let me know if this bug has been fixed  or more details are desired. Edit: Issue still exists with tipping  where updated amounts do not take effect. I am amazed that Uber has a bug with handling money still. Users of this app should not have to clear the app cache.,the app slightly past decently stable but i update tip within one hour change tip take effect if anyone reading let know bug fixed desired edit issue still tipping take effect i amazed bug handling money still app clear app cache

No option to contact the driver. Driver did not even bother to call me to update me. Called UberEats customer service - just told me that I will get a full refund. This is appalling service.

I get drivers need to be paid/tipped - but it's a rip off to base service fee on $ of order. It's ridiculous that 'service fee' based on $ of order.

One of the best delivery apps I have used,one best delivery i used
It has a wealth of options  but it doesn't tell you if your address is outwith delivery range until after you have already created your order. Near enough all of my 'Popular Near You' restaurants don't deliver to me  so why would they promote places I can't order from? It does nothing but drive me elsewhere. Unintuitive and should really be looked into.,it wealth tell address outwith delivery range already order near enough popular near you deliver would promote i order it nothing drive elsewhere unintuitive really
Prices are higher than normal plus charging for delivery and other add on fees. This is robbery. Makes it less appealing.,higher normal plus charging delivery add this robbery less appealing

It's a bit too pricy for me  takes ages and whenever I order McDonald's it's always squished and cold. I'd say the main pro is being able to track them on the map,it bit whenever i order always cold i would say main pro able track map
I had an issue with my order and when I tried to contact ubereats I was told nothing could be done because 'the order was placed 10 days ago'.

I like Uber Eats but if you don't use it often and would like to take advantage of the free delivery you have to rush through your order.

Terrible food app. Customer service is practically non-existent so if your food is bad and you want a refund  tough luck because your not going to be talking to a person  but forced to deal with a trash user interface that feels unsatisfactory and useless.

My girlfriend ordered food on the app and waited for it  they didnt show so she called and they ignored the fact the restaurant was closed and said the order had been cancelled in the system  she talked to a sup and they hung up on her!

Seems like there are less expensive fees for this app. It's probably because of where I am at and the type of restaurant I usually order from. Great app.,like less expensive app it probably i type restaurant i usually order great app
Every time I go on 《uber eats》there are more fees added for something!! The fees eventually exceed the actual amount of the order. McDonald's menu sucks and their individually priced items are quite rediculous!! Placss are able to take full advantage of the original in store prices!! Ugh get the gun! 😂 menu Options are boring and uninviting on app. There's no comparison to in store and a lot of the items in store are not online. That totally sucks!! Can more meal Options be added,every time i go eats added something the eventually exceed actual amount order menu individually priced quite able take full advantage original store ugh get gun face tears joy menu boring uninviting app there comparison store lot store that totally can meal added

Very reliable! Depends on the restaraunt but normally every order is correct and ontime!,very reliable normally every order correct
It started as a very convenient service. For the longest time now beside all of the fees that are now added to the food orders  it has become almost impossible to even get your order right. I have had so many issues with most of my orders as of late  that I decided to unistal the app and not use it again  especially after they stopped answering to complaints and help requests after an order is messed up  not only one  but twice on the same night  like it happened to us today. Enough is enough.,it convenient service for time beside added food become almost impossible even get order right i many late i decided app use especially stopped help order one twice night like us today enough enough

Awsome,
Set $0 delivery fee. And then somehow got charged $5.99 for a delivery fee. And doesn't seem to have any way to contact customer service over the issue. It didn't even give me 10 seconds to cancel the order after I realized how much they were charging me,set delivery fee and somehow got delivery fee and seem way contact customer service issue it even give cancel order i much charging

When it works  its great but when resraunts become unreliable  Uber has no real way to fix reoccurring issues. They offer refunds the first few times then just stay with your money regardless if your food gets delivered or not. The convenience factor is great. However this app can make dinner with the family a complete disaster if the food doesn't arrive and all they have to say is We hear you and we have contacted the restaurant for you. But %80 of the time its the drivers fault.,when works great become unreliable real way fix they offer first times stay money regardless food the convenience factor great however app make dinner family complete disaster food arrive say we hear restaurant but time fault

Repeat order cancellations  poor customer service. It very unreasonable to wait an hour for food to be delivered then have it canceled after a long wait. I feel disrespected and not valued. This is an unacceptable service. The point of delivery is get us food. There is no option given to assist with this and no discount option for you to order again. Its disappointing and very unsatisfactory. There should be better customer service for wasted time. I would give 0 stars over my recent experience.,repeat order poor customer service it unreasonable wait hour food long wait i feel valued this unacceptable service the point delivery get us food there option given assist discount option order its disappointing unsatisfactory there better customer service wasted time i would give recent experience

Don't waste your time installing this app  you will be left angry  hungry and if you talk to customer service  insulted.

It's okay  a bit expensive  but  if you do end up ordering  the delivery guys  they will call you ask for your personal information  and if you are absolutely can assure them that  you ARE who you said you were  and actually are able to pay the delivery guy  that's when they will decide to come.

Do yourself a favor and go use Postmates  Doordash  or literally ANY other delivery service because UberEATS is falling apart by the day. The worst customer service  inflated prices  and God forbid you need any kind of refund or price correction. Better hope you never have a cancelled order either because it'll be 10 days before any processing charges are returned. Even had them charge my PayPal (bank account) several days after an order had already been paid for & delivered. One word: THIEFS,do favor go use literally any delivery service falling apart day the worst customer service inflated god forbid need kind refund price correction better hope never order either days returned even charge bank account several days order already one word

This app does not even let you confirm your order before taking money out of your ACCOUNT!! ..... I was ordering my first order... After putting the order in the basket.... Without any click or confirmation order just went through..... No option for cancelation either.....restaurant started preparing straight away... Within seconds... .. Very strange... I WILL STICK TO JUST EAT... Awful experience... Spoiled our dinner 😣,this app even let confirm order taking money account i first order after order basket without click confirmation order went no option cancelation either restaurant straight away within very strange i will stick to just eat awful experience spoiled dinner persevering face
Orders are cancelled all the time hours after they are placed. I am not sure why Uber allows you to schedule a pickup because it's always after 5pm  nothing before that. Also  if you make an order at 1  it will auto cancel by 3. The fact there is no customer support says everything about Uber. They suck,time i sure schedule pickup always pm nothing also make order auto cancel the fact customer support everything they suck

I wasn't going to write a review but I changed my mind when I kept receiving phone calls about my order not being correct. I specifically ordered Seafood Enchiladas which is listed under that category. They had the driver call me to ask what type of seafood because apparently it only showed seafood and not enchiladas. I ordered chicken chimichangas under that specific category as well. Finally the lady from Guapos got on the phone. Very frustrating!,i going write review i mind i kept phone order correct i specifically ordered listed category they driver call ask type apparently i ordered chicken specific category well finally lady got phone very

First of all the driver went to the wrong address. Then when they finally arrived we were missing half our order. We called the restaurant and they said oh it happens all the time you need to contact Uber. They take more than one order at a time and give them to wrong customers or miss them out in the car. We then tried to call the driver and his phone was already blocked.,first driver went wrong address then finally missing half order we restaurant said oh time need contact they take one order time give wrong miss car we tried call driver phone already blocked

JUST BEEN ADVISED BY UBER TO UPDATE BECAUSE APP NOT WORKING - EVEN WORSE! CONSTANTLY STALLS IF YOU USE SEARCH OR ORDER FROM TWO PLACES  BETTER THAN JUST EAT. Installed and used the service once before being asked to verify my credit card which I did several times to no avail. I then installed the update - same problem. I even check with the bank that all was well before uploading a different card only to be asked to verify the new card before being advised that the account was disabled. 2019,just been advised by to update because app not working even worse constantly if you use search or order from two better than just eat used service verify credit card i several times avail i update problem i even check bank well different card verify new card advised account disabled

Update as of 02/22/2020: Although I've enjoyed the app  and will still use it again  I am reducing 1 Star  due to this Deal they started by offering free delivery if you schedule the delivery. It's not worth it. You get no map and the app cancelled one minute after the 7:45-8:15 delivery window (I ordered at 6:55pm) saying the restaurant couldn't accept my order  when in fact they just had no drivers. I spoke with the restaurant and went and picked up my order. I should reduce it 2 stars...,update although i app still use i reducing star due deal offering free delivery schedule delivery it worth you get map app one minute delivery window i ordered pm saying restaurant could accept order fact i spoke restaurant went picked order i reduce

Absolute rubbish  if you want an ice cold meal 2 hours late then this is the app for you. Once you have paid for the order that is the start of a lot of stress. You can not contact anyone about the order  you can also not cancel the order  even when you have been waiting for nearly two hours. Your food finally arrives when you don't really want it. Probably the worst service you could ever expect. Steer clear !,absolute rubbish want ice cold meal late app once order start lot stress you contact anyone order also cancel order even waiting nearly two your food finally really want probably worst service could ever expect steer clear

Uber made it so convenient to get what you feel like having that day. The app is easy to use and the gps tracking with two way comunication is extremly usfull.

Good for putting order. But it doesn't allow to select delivery address on map(like uber) and when we type address its shows nearest address which is already on the map then we have select it and type rest details again. This makes delivery guys confuse and they always go to the location shows on the map then call and says I'm here then I have to again guide them through phone to how to get to the correct address. This really been a nuisance  please add select delivery location on map feature.,good order but allow select delivery address map like type address nearest address already map select type rest this delivery confuse always go location map call i i guide phone get correct address this really nuisance please add select delivery location map feature

This app works great for what it promises when it works correctly. Ive had odd past charges appear as im checking out and sometimes the food is less than equal to what ive actually ordered- which I know is a problem on the restaurant's end and not the actual app. Whenever that does occur I can just ask for a refund for what didnt appear which is super convenient and a great feature.

When installing the app  Uber asks for a number  great that works; then Uber asks for an email address - I use the email address that's been registered prior and I get an error that the email has already been registered  but that's the point  however I'm not able to log in. In an attempt to login with a registered email  I cannot login to the app. You force me to use a brand new email just to register.

Help should be easier to reach through the app. I spent a while getting a refund for an order that I'm pretty sure wasn't really my fault. A coupon they sent was misleading  it said 20 eur min order (when in reality it meant 20 eur min AFTER coupon is applied)  I cancelled an order right after confirming it. Initially got charged 25 eur cancellation. Clarity on cancellation fees  also make it a reasonable amount please. Their customer service sounds so unhappy sorry I was angry  it was at uber:),help easier reach app i spent getting refund order i pretty sure really fault a coupon sent misleading said min order reality meant min after coupon applied i order right confirming initially got cancellation clarity cancellation also make reasonable amount please their customer service unhappy sorry i angry

I love uber eats app its very convenient! What i usually have an issue with is the fast food place i order from (Forgettimg items that i paid for) or the drivers (Wromg car Rude   slow ect) .i think uber eats should make the food places send in conformation of the complete delivered orders so uber eats knows how they are doing as far as their service and performance because if its not good people could blame uber instead of the right company or employee. But overall i am thankful for uber eats!,i love eats app convenient what usually issue fast food place order car rude slow think eats make food send conformation complete eats far service performance good people could blame instead right company employee but overall thankful eats

Where the hell are my pickles? I order from wawa I ask for a side of pickles in the requests section since the option isn't available in the menu on uber eats like it is in store. I've asked 3 or 4 times  never gotten pickles. Wawa pickles are the bomb that's why I want them. If I had the ability to message the person picking up my food before they pick it up  I would  but you can't contact a delivery person until after they pick up your food. Not a great app,where hell i order wawa i ask side section since option available menu eats like store i times never gotten wawa bomb i want if i ability message person food pick i would contact delivery person pick food not great app

The app basically sucks. Long story short  took my money never gave it back. Apparently it takes 10 days to process the money back but it doesn't take long to charge the account.

After a recent update. Uber Eats made it so that delivers fee are a dollar but still charge for service fee. Not to mention if your order is under a certain amount  they'll add another fee and finally to top it off. They make it so you HAVE to tip the driver BEFORE they deliver your food. Honestly  after today I will be removing the app and looking for another alternative. Honestly  don't order from your local restaurants  paying almost 50% more than you would if you were to go there yourself.,after recent update eats made fee dollar still charge service fee not mention order certain amount add another fee finally top they make have tip driver before deliver food honestly today i removing app looking another alternative honestly order local paying almost would go

Great app! There are a few restaurants who say that they don't receive the order through the system  but only through the drivers.

Uber decides to add additional deliveries along your route WITHOUT your permission. So I paid full price for delivery  to receive cold food because Uber decided to send the driver on a separate delivery route while transporting my food. When you order an Uber ride  you have an option to Uberpool or ride in UberX by yourself and pay the difference. But nooo with Ubereats  you pay full price and they decide whether your food will be Uberpool or not. Very inconsiderate.,add additional along route without permission so i full price delivery receive cold food decided send driver separate delivery route transporting food when order ride option ride pay difference but pay full price decide whether food very inconsiderate

Estimated delivery time and the person picking up the order changes every 15 minutes. Been waiting for food for more than 1 hour 30 minutes. Everytime I check it gives different name of the driver. After almost 2 hours of waiting  it says 'order cancellaed  courier was unable to deliver'. What a disappointment,delivery time person order every been waiting food hour i check different name driver after almost waiting order courier unable deliver what disappointment

Won't run on a google pixel 3a xl. Sad. Edited: And apparently  UberEats can't even give enough effort to actually reply to a negative review. That's a link to their generic help section  not a method of contacting them. So they can't put in enough effort to make the app function on a modern device  and can't put in enough effort to reply to people when they're frustrated that the app won't work on their devices. So in other words  they're throwing out a net to capture as many hapless suckers as possible to waste overblown money on an app that overcharges  doesn't tip restaurants or servers  sneakily raises prices without telling you  won't give you accurate estimates on delivery times  and won't even bother to make sure it'll function at stealing your money. What an absolute load of tripe. No  UberEats  I'm not going to go through the process of navigating through your website's help section  finding a method of contacting you (Which I'm /certain/ you've hidden behind dozens of links because you can't be bothered to actually answer me)  and go through the process of taking a class on learning how to use your website. This went from a nine word review to an over-two-hundred word review because you halfassed your response so very poorly. Food apps are literally the worst. Waste your time spending on another gacha game  you'll get more satisfaction and nutrition out of your life with less time wasted.,wo run sad and apparently even give enough effort actually reply negative review that link generic help section method so put enough effort make app function modern device put enough effort reply people app work so throwing net capture many hapless possible waste overblown money app tip without telling give accurate delivery times even bother make sure function stealing money what absolute load tripe no i going go process help section finding method which i certain hidden behind links actually answer go process taking class learning use this went nine word review two hundred word review response poorly food literally worst waste time spending another game get satisfaction nutrition life less time wasted

I have been able to reach customer service each and every time I call it for whatever reason I disconnect it before someone picked up they always called me back and it's not necessarily that I'm having a problem with Uber per say it may be just the restaurant that I'm having a problem with but they do correct the problem,i able reach customer service every time i call whatever reason i disconnect someone picked always back necessarily i problem per say may restaurant i problem correct problem
Really poor after sales support. When their drivers fail to deliver  they cannot solve the issue  but instead will send you automated messages. Mr Delivery offers far better local support. If you log a support about more than one issue  they threaten to block your account for abuse. *Edit:* I received the same standard reply from the developer. Your support refuses to help any more. See order C6CEC  support replied by saying we won't be able to respond to further messages on this issue.,really poor support when fail deliver solve issue instead send delivery far better local support if log support one issue threaten block account abuse edit i received standard reply developer your support help see order c cec support saying able respond issue

I had only just installed the app so clearing the cashe does nothing. Instead of blaming it on people's phones accept responsibility and fix your app!!! For all those reviews about the wait time increasing  I work for uber eats and that will normally be down to drivers using more than one delivery app like deliveroo and they are prioritizing other orders before yours or picking up an order from somewhere else before they deliver your food.,i app clearing nothing instead blaming people accept responsibility fix app for wait time increasing i work eats normally one delivery app like order somewhere else deliver food

Delivery depends upon the driver. Some cannot follow directions  so the food is cold. A delivery from two blocks away can involve a 12 block detour when the driver doesn't know the area or follow directions. Limited restaurants late-night which is a drag for guys like me who work late. On the other hand  some of the drivers are awesome and hard-working  so that is a plus.,delivery upon driver some follow food cold a delivery two away involve block detour driver know area follow limited late night drag like work late on hand awesome hard working plus

Uber in general is an awful company to work for  being customer or any other relation to it. EDIT: What details would you like to have? About the income? About the way you treat drivers?

Kinda Awful Really. Ive used this app numerous times a college student in Philly. I cant tell you how many times the drivers have straight up taken my food - 5min away from delivery  making me wait for nothing. Or missing key items  or reeking of weed.

Zero communication until way after the fact and when I get to talk to them they lied and fought against the none dellivery claim for nearly 2 hours.

Spoke too soon on my last review. I wasted $40 ordering McDonald's only to receive a cold bag of food that reeked of some strange chemical odor  and the Big Mac had been bitten into.

Complete failure to address the situation so far.

Asks me to rate app every time it is viewed. 2/18/20 EDIT: Every time I opened the app or woke up my phone after I set it down  I would get a pop-up asking me to rate the app. Doesn't happen anymore  so I'm increasing my rating. 3-stars because it's convenient and app is easy. However  I've made numerous orders and there are problems w/ over 50% of them. Mostly it's the restaurant's fault (the app works fine and driver's are mostly great) but food is often missing items  wrong items  or cold. 2/20/20 EDIT: In response to Uber's reply with the link: Thanks  but I have done that already. I made the issue known for each problematic order at the time I made the purchase. Sometimes the restaurant tires to make things right  sometimes not. I included it in this review not for Uber's benefit  but for potential customers who want to know about the quality of UberEats.,rate app every time edit every time i app woke phone i set i would get pop rate app does happen i increasing rating convenient app easy however i made numerous w mostly restaurant fault app works fine driver mostly great food often missing wrong cold edit in response reply link thanks i done already i made issue known problematic order time i made purchase sometimes restaurant make right sometimes i included review benefit potential want know quality

They have refused to send out the missing items and refused to give me a refund for them because I had problems with my first order. That's £10 of my money they have taken and not given me what I have paid for! This company should be illegal!!!,avoid like plague only ordered eats twice the second order half food missing arrive cold they send missing give refund i first order that money taken given i this company illegal
Great app  simple to use. Waiting times varu to be honest so its not always accurate. Also disappointed about the fact that you have to spend £15 to get a discount of £10.,great app simple use waiting times honest always accurate also disappointed fact spend get discount

Absolutely horrible service. Why do you take an order when you don't have enough delivery people? Waited 2 hours for my food and when I contact customer service they asked me to wait as they are trying to assign a delivery person. After 2 hours. Pathetic. This was the last time I ordered with you.,absolutely horrible service why take order enough delivery people food i contact customer service wait trying assign delivery person after pathetic this last time i ordered

A couple weeks ago this app was very incosistant (orders going through but no one to pick up/ taking over an hour for a food place 15min away from my work) but within the last 2 weeks they have been more on top of it or at least showing that they were unavailable/ short on drivers or overloaded with orders. I'd rather open the app and see its unavailable then order something and an hour later have it be canceled without a reason.,a couple ago app going one pick taking hour food place min away work within last top least showing unavailable short i would rather open app see unavailable order something hour later without reason

Great little app! I use it nearly every time I am working onsite. Great for pickup or delivery. One wish. I'm often offering for pickup at the stop light (not while driving). I always order the same thing  but I have to put in the add-ons every time. It would be so handy to have this as a one click order and just be able to press a button and have the custom order go through on the default payment  maybe with one confirmation summary with total.,great little app i use nearly every time i working great pickup delivery one wish i often offering pickup stop light driving i always order thing i put add ons every time it would handy one click order able press button custom order go default payment maybe one confirmation summary total
Worst experience ever. Everytime I ordered food they over charged me and wouldn't refund me for ages.

I'm rating it 2 stars and starts thinking of deleting the app for good...

So disappointed with my experience tonight- I was so hungry that I tracked my order the whole time. I received the wrong order and reported it in the app. I received no response  so I took the food back to the restaurant and explained to the cashier what happened. The restaurant never even received my order from Uber Eats! I had to order and pay for it again. Now  after calling Uber Eats  I get to wait 3-5 days for a refund. There are not enough characters to express how inconvenient this was!,so disappointed experience tonight i hungry i tracked order whole time i received wrong order app i received response i took food back restaurant cashier the restaurant never even received order eats i order pay now calling eats i get wait days refund there enough express inconvenient

Why does it tell me to use Zomato when I have downloaded Uber eats. If Zomato has acquired Uber eats then just remove this app from the playstore rather than just making people download this app and make an account and then redirecting them to download Zomato and use it to order food. it's just a waste of time,why tell use i eats if acquired eats remove app rather making people app make account use order food waste time

They just cancelled the order after me waiting for an hour. They justify it by saying there was an issue and the money was refunded! They just don't realise that the issue is we waited for an hour hungry to have lunch and they just cancelled. Their support is pathetic too. Trust me.. Find other food delivery options..there are many around. Uber responded asking me to refer to a link  which I had already done earlier. They just responded saying they had some difficulty and returned my money.,they order waiting hour they justify saying issue money they issue hour hungry lunch their support pathetic trust find food delivery many around refer link i already done they saying difficulty returned money
Uber eats hasn't resolved the issue of a wrongly charged amount and outstanding balance is still visible in my account. With regards to this I had already emailed uber support on 11/01/2019.It's because inspite of me mentioning the address & location clearly on map the rider kept on calling me(illogically) to ask my location and when I couldn't pick up phone  he cancelled my order without even reaching the location and when I called back he refused to deliver. He didn't even return it to hotel.,eats resolved issue wrongly amount outstanding balance still visible account with i already support it address location clearly map rider kept calling illogically ask location i could pick phone order without even reaching location i back deliver he even return hotel

I had a few good experiences with the app  but one bad experience ruined it all. I waited three hours for a delivery and had no way to contact the driver or the Customer Service. The phone number needs to be somewhere accessible. When I reached out to Uber Eats  their only solution was to cancel the order and assure me I wouldn't be charged. This screams of a half measure. No compensation was offered at any point.,i good app one bad experience ruined i three delivery way contact driver customer service the phone number needs somewhere accessible when i eats solution cancel order assure i would this half measure no compensation point

Convenient  but expensive for food delivery and I have had multiple issues with wrong orders and being charged for orders that never arrived. Also  i most recently I had to deal with a situation where I was sent identical double orders and was charged the matching double charge for an order that I only ordered once. Over all not extremely happy and I am going to uninstall the app regardless of the convenience.

Its miss leading. I think it is absolutely wrong that the Uber drivers will pick up multiple orders and deliver them all along the way.

Ordered from a chain restaurant. Eta was an hour or so. That fine. Kept getting delayed eventually by almost an hour extra. Sitting on can't find a driver. Cancelling would still charge because the food was already made... So I'm just waiting for cold food? At some point my order is cancelled and the restaurant becomes listed as unavailable on the app. Will not use this service again.,ordered chain restaurant eta hour that fine kept getting eventually almost hour extra sitting find driver would still charge food already made so i waiting cold food at point order restaurant becomes listed unavailable app will use service

I keep traveling all the time and have found uber eats convenient many times  until i had issues. They charge you for an order  tracker shows the time  and preparing for delivery status  but food Never arrives.. They simply want to take the money but not the responsibility. Don't suggest this app to anybody.the only response you get from the help center is a fake apology and a message that says they won't be able to refund the money for you. Its so frustrating,i keep traveling time found eats convenient many times they charge order tracker time delivery status food never they simply want take money responsibility do suggest app anybody response get help center fake apology message able refund money its

Very bad service waste time and money. Unfortunately it looks like drivers don't want to pick up your orders anymore if you don't tip them from beginning not after the service. 3 hours I have been waiting for my order. What a joke.

I honestly dont normally leave reviews on apps but I had to with this one. I was using door dash before and thought they were pretty good but I LOVE UBER EATS. It is so much faster and delivery fees are much lower  there are options if multiple restaurants are within delivery distance. You can actually track the order and see how close the driver is instead of the rough timing estimate on door dash. 10/10 recommend if you want a simple and easy delivery app,i honestly dont normally leave i one i door dash thought pretty good i love eats it much faster delivery much lower multiple within delivery distance you actually track order see close driver instead rough timing estimate door dash recommend want simple easy delivery app

When it works well it's great. However my biggest gripe is the ETA. You can't have an ETA and just keep adding a minute to it while it hasn't arrived. Like  why have a been waiting 20 minutes watching my ETA increase by a minute for every minute that passes. I get that there are some things that are out of their control  but this is a bit ridiculous,when works well great however biggest gripe eta you eta keep minute like waiting watching eta increase minute every minute i get control bit ridiculous
I really like this app  my food is always delivered in a timely fashion.

Use useless drivers who deliver cold food. The guy couldnt follow a gps and went to 3 different locations. And called for directions constantly. He didnt read extra instructions and delivered cold food. So I did not accept it. I informed UBER eats who said they cant do anything about this and they are just a 3rd party app. They wont give refund or credit. Useless app. dont bother. Plus now I am trying to delete my account but there is no way to delete it. Or my credit card details.,use useless deliver cold food the guy follow went different and constantly he didnt read extra cold food so i accept i informed eats said cant anything rd party app they wont give refund credit useless app dont bother plus i trying delete account way delete or credit card

Ubereats is not that bad. If something happens  they can refund you and usually will. However  when something bad happens (order unfulfilled  etc.)  the experience is terrible. It sucks when you're ubereats driver doesnt deliver your order and youre hungry as hell. It sucks when you're supposed to be studying and eating but you are wasting yor time writing an angry review. Ubereats isnt the worst thing in the world. But it can definitely do better.,bad if something refund usually however something bad order unfulfilled experience terrible it driver doesnt deliver order hungry hell it supposed eating wasting yor time writing angry review worst thing world but definitely better

App is fine. Problem is it tells me the restaurant had requested for more time while delaying my order for an hour... 15 minutes at a time. While my food sits ready at the restaurant (I know because I called) the problem was actually they had no drivers... I tried to cancel and couldn't get a chance to cancel... Can't complain  no customer service... Insanity. Worst customer service possible.,app fine problem restaurant time delaying order hour time while food ready restaurant i know i problem actually i tried cancel could get chance cancel ca complain customer service insanity worst customer service possible
Half the time they can't find a driver for an order. The other half they find a driver half an hour late and your food is cold by the time you get it. You can't even get a refund because at that point it's passed their five minute requirement for cancellations. I do not recommend.,half time find driver order the half find driver half hour late food cold time get you even get refund point five minute requirement i recommend
Uber eats has been cancelling my order for no reason just outside my house,eats order reason outside house

not worth the hassle. Edit. Yes why is a delivery that used to be advertised around 7.99 now says its 4.99 but with an additional fee of 4.78 coming up to just under 10? Somehow it just keeps getting worse over time with even more overbloated charges that quite frankly cannot be justified. Pick out an order around 17 and change  expect to pay at least 26 if you dont tip.,worth hassle edit yes delivery used around additional fee coming somehow getting worse time even quite frankly pick order around change expect pay least dont tip

Really? What is wrong with this app? I was in contact with my driver and I asked if he could cancel the order. I got a notification saying 'Your Deliver Was Attempted' on the phone he said he was at the restaurant and noticed that the delivery was to a military base  that's when I told him if he can cancel. He said he did and it still showed him on the map as the delivery driver. Now I didn't get a refund  did I just get scammed from this uber eats app?,really what wrong app i contact driver i could cancel order i got notification saying your deliver was phone said restaurant delivery military base i told cancel he said still map delivery driver now i get refund i get eats app

La aplicación funciona bastante bien  pero el servicio en general no. El día domingo 16 de febrero hicimos un pedido y la comida no llegó  pero el repartidor sí cerró la orden indicando que lo ordenado había sido recibido. Luego repetimos  pero esta vez el repartidor se desconectó en pleno trayecto y la comida jamás fue retirada en el local. Nos devolvieron el dinero y terminamos ordenando por Rappi. Recibimos la comida en menos de media hora. Uber Eats no demostró ninguna preocupación.,la bien el en general el de un la el la lo el se en la en el local el dinero la en de media hora eats

Poor. Terrible  useless customer service  do you even read my queries?! And why can't we see other people's written reviews? Fix up. Also  the free delivery promotion doesn't update properly lol. Just a method to pressure you into ordering from somewhere quickly. What a joke. Edit to reply to your response: I already contacted your 'customer service' and got nowhere. You got back to me  I'll give you that  but you offered no resolution or refund. Sooo...,poor terrible useless customer service even read and see people written fix also free delivery promotion update properly just method pressure somewhere quickly what joke edit reply response i already customer service got nowhere you got back i give resolution refund

So first it was regular Uber not taking my ride request and telling me that 'something went wrong' and I got passed around the customer service department .. it's still not working. And now Uber Eats does the same thing. Do you not want my money? No help from them at all .. the last interaction I was basically told 'We don't know what's wrong .. sorry' Awesome *sarcasm*,so first regular taking ride request telling went wrong i got around customer service department still working and eats thing do want money no help last interaction i basically told we know wrong sorry awesome sarcasm

Do not use this service. I had to out the order in twice because the app refreshed and it doesn't save. Delivery estimates are complete fiction.

I used this app almost daily to order  it was mostly good with the occasional order mess up  but the call support customer service is the absolute WORST!

UBER Eats is trash I am a truck driver so I used this app a lot. However I made a order that had the wrong address and state. Tried to cancel but wouldn't give me the option to cancel or even contact driver. I had to call the 1800 number but was told after the put me on hold many times that the order would be canceled but they were not going to refund me my order. So the deliver driver got a free $22 meal. So Uber can kiss my *** I will never use any Uber services again. Deleted all Uber apps,eats trash i truck driver i used app lot however i made order wrong address state tried cancel would give option cancel even contact driver i call number told put hold many times order would going refund order so deliver driver got free meal so kiss i never use

This is a very bad app  they pull out offers all days but Every time I used an offer I had to fight them back every time for the money (something always fails) ... I'm sick entire that these big companies can do whatever they want and get away with it  and growing.. Be careful on their offers  I just uninstalled this app. I've contacted again with support team and as I cannot prove that what I did was ok and that the app didn't work ok  they've just ignored me. Don't recommend this app!!18/02,this bad app pull days every time i used offer i fight back every time money something always i sick entire big whatever want get away growing be careful i uninstalled app i support team i prove i app work do recommend app
I think 2 out of every 10 orders placed are correct. Don't get me wrong  I still use the app. But it's the same with all these delivery places.

When items are missing  don't expect to get any help straight away. We once had almost half the order missing. I noticed straight away and the driver would tell you to contact Uber Eats. Contact Uber who would not get back to you until the next day. I understand that mistakes happen but it is frustrating when no one takes responsibility of resolving the issue and you're left with a hungry family. There needs to be a better system in place. Happened again today when my brother ordered.,when missing expect get help straight away we almost half order missing i straight away driver would tell contact eats contact would get back next day i understand happen one responsibility issue left hungry family there needs better system place today brother ordered

Terrible service. The app never tells me before I pay how far away a driver is. This has lead to me ordering food and not receiving it for nearly an hour. More than once. The drivers never come to my door. And to top it off they have possibly the most useless help option on the app. All it does is tell you how to check the status of your order and basically says just wait. We cant control the drivers. And they make it impossible to find the actual customer service line.,terrible service the app never i pay far away driver this lead food nearly hour more the never come door and top possibly useless help option app all tell check status order basically wait we cant control and make impossible find actual customer service line

I don't like that the app stop making it able to track the drivers coming to you. Uber was the one who originally started tracking the drivers. so you know where they're at and when to be at the door at on time. I don't like this new update to their system. They need to put it back the way it used to be. where you can track the drivers and see where your food is. Or if you are going to get a ride where the drivers at.,i like app stop making able track coming one originally know door time i like new update system they need put back way used track see food or going get ride

Maps need updating. Every time I order I have to walk up the block to a different street to get my order. It's not my app that does not work it's your own drivers who can't find my house. I have lived there for 3 years and your maps are not updated. Drivers have asked me to say please use Google maps in the special instructions so that they can get to me.,need every time i order i walk block different street get order it app work find house i lived say please use special get

The map pip for our address is always in the wrong spot in the app  making many deliveries difficult for drivers and we often have to head far outside to track down the drivers. We should be able to customize where the delivery pip lands... Grub hub manages to place their pip in the right spot.,the map pip address always wrong spot app making many difficult often head far outside track we able delivery pip grub hub place pip right spot
Puts a hold on the funds in your account and then after the food comes the app charges the card again for the full amount. Basically they lock up the equivalent of your order cost for a few business days and also charge you for your order. Good to eat as long as you don't mind paying and also lending them the cost of your order for a few days. Very very flawed system. Will never use this again.,hold funds account food comes app card full amount basically lock equivalent order cost business days also charge order good eat long mind paying also cost order days very flawed system will never use

Annoying that you cannot change payment details until you make an order. I have had multiple issues with a particular restaurant forgetting items  yet when I ask for a refund on these items on this app (which I am entitled to given I paid for them and didn't receive)  I get a threatening email to deactivate my account if I ask for too many refunds. How about holding restaurants accountable for terrible service?! Then when you try to rectify  ubereats of course has no system to help!,annoying change payment make order i multiple particular restaurant forgetting yet i ask refund app i given i receive i get threatening deactivate account i ask many how holding accountable terrible service then try rectify course system help
The uber eats service is awful. They take orders even when they have no ability to deliver at the time promised. I ordered pizzas from a place a few miles away. The restaurant cooked the food on time and it sat 55 minutes completed before the driver picked it up. The restaurant kept contacting uber to come and they did not. The order was an hour and a half late and the food was cold and Soggy. Uber eats still had not done anything to resolve despite 8 messages to them. Use any other service,the eats service awful they take even ability deliver time i ordered place away the restaurant food time sat driver picked the restaurant kept come the order hour half late food cold soggy eats still done anything resolve despite use service

Need to make the address more clear!!!

Uber Eats has no phone customer service  they charged me $29 for food I never received  I called the restaurant and they never made the order. I emailed customer support and was told It was too late for a refund and I needed to provide a receipt sooner next time  except they never even sent me a receipt.

Will NEVER use again.,eats phone customer service food i never received i restaurant never made order i customer support told it late refund i provide receipt sooner next time except never even sent receipt literally theft need purchase bank will never use
You know what you're here for. It's 2am  you're all kinds of messed up and you need someone to bring you food to stuff your drunk face. Uber eats does it best. You'll regret how much you spent  what you ate  and it's rarely worth the price; all before you pass out with a half finished slice of pizza. But you'll be back next Thursday.,you know it need someone bring food stuff drunk face eats best you regret much spent ate rarely worth price pass half finished slice pizza but back next

Awful service. The app had a glitch. The payment didn't go through so I ordered again. Same thing happened again. I then received two deliveries despite having neither order confirmed. Uber Eats refused to refund my second or and were unbelievably unhelpful and dismissive. Rip off. EDIT: I SENT SEVERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS AT THE TIME AND UE WEREN'T INTERESTED. AN UE EMPLOYEE ADMITTED THAT THE FAULT LAY WITH UE BUT THERE WAS STILL NO REFUND. I'M NOW ASKED TO FILL IN ANOTHER FORM?,awful service the app the payment go i ordered same thing i received two despite neither order confirmed eats refund second unbelievably unhelpful dismissive rip edit i sent several of this at the time and t interested an employee admitted that the fault lay with but there was still no refund i m now to fill in another form

I can't understand why you make it so hard for people to recover their access to their accounts. My old phone is dead and I now have a new phone number. It's been almost a year since I used Uber Eats because I didn't like how my order was canceled several times. I don't remember my password at this time and that's why I need help to access my account.

Multiple times I've had issues with orders and about 90% of the time Uber support does the absolute least to help you solve the problem. Just today had an order cancled that i paid with a gift card and now i have to wait 1-3 buisness day to get a refund  and it was cancled as the order was being picked up. My suggestions  more attentive with the customers and provide a something to the customer rather than a wait to get your money and order again.,multiple times i time support absolute least help solve problem just today order gift card wait day get refund order picked my attentive provide something customer rather wait get money order
I cant use the app anymore since Uber thinks my phone number is attached to a different account I can't access.

Cheap delivery fee's  fast delivery drivers  and alot of close by restaurants are using Uber Eats to send deliveries. Food prices vary and tax+delivery fee isn't an outrageous amount. I'm very satisfied with this app. 😎👍🏻,cheap delivery fee fast delivery close eats send food vary tax delivery fee outrageous amount i satisfied app smiling face sunglasses thumbs light skin tone
Keeps saying welcome back even though I have never had a account!? My husband and both of my teenagers tried as well they have diff emails and phone numbers the app did the same to them!?

Updating to 4 stars as the App itself has become quite good compared to the competitors. Also some Promos and free delivery options makes it impressive! The only feature I would request to add is a chat option between customers and restaurants  so if any update needs to be done before order confirmation  they can do it instantly! 1 star missing because I believe you can do better with promos and overall cost!,app become quite good also free delivery impressive the feature i would request add chat option update needs done order confirmation instantly star missing i believe better overall cost

Uber eats is a pretty great concept. The app is well designed and functionality is great. I've had issues with deliveries in the past  but support has usually been good although not always great (like a chatbot crossed with an outsourcer) but people I've spoken to have usually eventually solved my problem.

I placed an order via UberEats with delivery time max for 30 mnts. Since the order was not delivered even after about 45 mnts I had to call and was informed that they missed my order and can be delivered in about another 40 mnts more with out even a proper apology for their mistake. Their irresponsible act made my kids left without dinner for hours which I don't believe any father will take lightly. Pathetic  irresponsible service from both #Domino's and #Ubereats.,i order via delivery time since order even i call informed order another even proper apology mistake their irresponsible act made left without dinner i believe father take lightly pathetic irresponsible service domino

I got an email with 90% discount on my order with a maximum of 20€  when I tried to order they said it was for maximum 15€ (which is still fine) but it was impossible to order due to server problems Also their app design is not clear and it is difficult to find what did you order and where did you sent the order.,they improve lot app design server i got discount order maximum i tried order said maximum still fine impossible order due server also app design clear difficult find order sent order

I reek one-star because it does not give the customer flexibility to contact customer support or contact delivery personnel. What do you do if delivery guy decides to not move? Literally! I am watching him on the map and he did not move at all until the very last minute. Now mind you  a little after midnight at 1:35 a.m. and the McDonalds I order from was less than a mile away. Also absolutely no traffic. You guys need to add extra features for delivery personnel and drivers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i reek one star give customer flexibility contact customer support contact delivery personnel what delivery guy move literally i watching map move last minute now mind little midnight i order less mile away also absolutely traffic you need add extra delivery personnel

Scam!!!! Must be shutdown. Lies!!!!!,scam must shutdown
Service is good  HOWEVER they recently changed their policies in California so if you don't spend $15 you are charged a $3 small order fee  which is outrageous. $15 worth of food is a lot for one person. On top of that  the app does not round up. There have been so many times I've hit $14.99 because the majority of restaurants end their costs in .99  and the app won't count it as meeting the $15 minimum. EDIT: The dev responded without taking into account their California policy. Not helpful.,service good however recently spend small order fee outrageous worth food lot one person on top app round there many times i hit majority end app count meeting minimum edit the dev without taking account policy not helpful

Lamentable experiencia. Recibí un pedido de comida donde parte del mismo estaba quemado.

The worst experience I've had with food delivery service. We waiting a complete hour for our food. 7:09-8:09 just to have our order canceled when it notified that the driver was on the way.

I will delete this app and use Postmates or GrubHub for better service.,the worst experience i food delivery service we waiting complete hour food order notified driver way then i hung nothing rectify problem i delete app use better service

You are too expensive  service fee  tip  and a delivery fee  even with the promotion it was expensive. Won't use you again and I won't recommend my friends actually I'm going to Facebook and tell my friends and the public how expensive you really are. What's the difference in a service and delivery fee? Heck ! I use DoorDash w/o the extra fees its cheaper and just as fast  I like comparing. Use Uber to bring me home from work  never again for food $17/ 3 items w/ promo 🤬gave 1* for the food,you expensive service fee tip delivery fee even promotion expensive wo use i recommend actually i going tell public expensive really what difference service delivery fee heck i use w extra fast i like use bring home work never food w face symbols mouth gave food

EDIT: It is not solved. I didn't received for my discount 😔 PAST: Their inability to solve issues is unbelievable. I had problems with extra charges about 3x times. Plus  they give us credits and does not apply to our orders. I had to contact the support  with no luck  the support basically told me that I got the credit applied  but my Bank statement and my Order receipt on the Uber app wasn't with any discount. You just lost a user that expend more than 500$ per month.

EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE DELIVERY RATES Reply to the developers: I do understand that the fees change depending on my location  however that isn't the problem.

It's just too expensive now for individuals. There used to just be a delivery fee but now there is a delivery fee  a service fee  a small order fee and so it costs about $10 for what are labeled as $2.99 deliveries on the app. On top there are markedly increased delivery fees at regular meal times even on weekends when there is no traffic. If not for all the hidden fees that keep growing and growing  the app would be pretty decent.,it expensive there used delivery fee delivery fee service fee small order fee app on top markedly delivery regular meal times even traffic if hidden keep growing growing app would pretty decent

Do not I repeat do not expect anything but a round about from there support team apologizing for your bad experience and asking you to rate the order and delivery staff to completely resolve the issue and ask you to respond if it does not so they can send you the same response again and ask it again. Don't waste your time . Go to Postmates where they match the problem with a solution like a way to get a replacement or a refund for the horrible food.

I liked it at first  but it has now for the third damn time given me a terrible delivery driver. It's been almost 3 hours since my order should've been here  yet I still don't have it. Driver has driven past where my order was placed 5 times  and even went to Tacoma and just sat in the same spot for 15 minutes straight. And there are other reviews like mine that complain about similar issues that the developers refuse to fix. I'd give this app zero stars if I could,i first third damn time given terrible delivery driver it almost since order yet i still driver driven past order times even went sat spot straight and like mine complain similar refuse fix i would give app zero i could

She never showed up and I need my money back. It's a very stupid app and people steal your food. It's not safe to use as they won't even reply to your messages and your money is also lost.

While you can Track your driver in real time for when he's going to drop off your order. Since 2 weeks ago (beginning of Feb) almost any times I order from a place that's over 1 mile away is too far away so now the app is just about unusable. Using other food delivery apps.

Bad service from Uber eats. Had a massive issue with my order with food being raw and cold and added in sauce that I was allergic to. I contacted them and it took them a whole hour to respond which by that time I had not eaten and the whole evening just became a disappointment.

I ordered dennys (literal 2 minutes away from my house  10 minute walk) and the driver had picked up the order after an hour  and then got on the highway  went the complete opposite direction (to the airport actually  15 minutes away) and then came to drop off my food. By the time it got here (1 hour and 45 minutes after placing the order) everything was cold  i still ate it. Now i woke up the next morning with what feels like food poisoning.

Worst costumer support I've ever seen. I had an order and I didn't receive anything that I asked for. Tried to contact for help and still nothing and this happened 2 days ago.

Uber gave no help when order didn't arrive. Other than 'submitting' a problem  there is no way of contacting uber to ask where your order is & why does your account say delivered when no one has turned up at all (we waited outside) & nothing has been delivered to anyone in the street. Uber to advises to tell them straight away if you recieve emailed receipt & your order doesn't arrive but 4 hours later no delivery & no communication at all from Uber. Will go to consumer affairs. Refund requird,gave help order arrive other problem way ask order account say one turned outside nothing anyone street tell straight away receipt order arrive later delivery communication will go consumer refund

Use JUST EAat rather than Uber ears. When restaurant order that you receive is wrong items missing  food have incredients that you said not to add to the food  it is me who takes the hit. Uber reply to missing items and wrong items is that they cannot help with this at all. If you use JUST EAT and order is wrong they do help you to get refund or replacement of the food. Often if something is not wanted to be in the food is that one is allergic to something. Bad service.,use just rather when restaurant order receive wrong missing food said add food hit reply missing wrong help if use just eat order wrong help get refund replacement food often something food one allergic something bad service

It keeps saying invalid payment method please update billing settings even when I have clearly set the payment method to cash and it works perfectly fine the same way on my father's phone.

Prices are way to big  a very small rage of restaurants with unrealistic pictures  and the most of them have really bad food. I once placed an order and the app told me that my order was not proceeded  hence I placed it again. I ended up getting two meals (which also happened to be the worst that I have ever received from UberEats) and I had to pay the shipping twice  even if they were delievered by the same person. Try Takeaway or Food Panda instead  better prices and great food.,way big small rage unrealistic really bad food i order app told order hence i i ended getting two also worst i ever received i pay shipping twice even person try food panda instead better great food

This is hands down the best app for food delivery. Their customer service is honestly as good as it gets. I love how the rewards cross over with uber.

Watch out  they'll hit you with those secret fees. Almost ordered 19$ worth of food (getting delivery fee knocked off thanks to a neighbor)  but then they add a service fee  tax  and tip. Came out to 32$. I can't imagine paying 38$ for 2 pizzas and a breadstick XD Edit: After having the Uber staff respond to me  all I can say is this: Can't wait til you guys bankrupt. Pay your drivers a living wage  or would that be too much for your millionaires? Can't wait to UberEat the rich!,watch hit secret almost ordered worth food getting delivery fee thanks neighbor add service fee tax tip came i imagine paying edit after staff respond i say ca wait til bankrupt pay living wage would much ca wait rich

I will never use this service again. I ordered food for my 30 minute lunch to be delivered between 3-3:30 and now because the ETA is 3:45 when I placed my order a hour an advanced. Then they won't let you cancel the order. Now I'm out of money and have to finish my shift hungry.

Uber Eats is the worst amongst the bunch. Their support team doesn't listen and they'll gladly take the money from your account but take 3-10 business days to put it back. I've had so many meals get cancelled after waiting 40 mins to an hour for it to come. Better off using postmates or doordash,eats worst amongst bunch their support team listen gladly take money account take business days put back i many get waiting hour come better

Tried to order from a restaurant twice  but didn't appear to go through  nothing in pending orders. Ordered from somewhere else and went through. Suddenly I get notifications that my first two orders were on their way. Tried to call  but nobody could help me and told me to go through app. Obviously don't want or need these now and I'm now out of pocket £30 which I didn't know had been spent. Ubereats refuse to give me a refund for their problem. Awful customer service. Never using again.,tried order restaurant twice appear go nothing pending ordered somewhere else went suddenly i get first two way tried call nobody could help told go app obviously want need i pocket i know spent refuse give refund problem awful customer service never

A good app. Only bad thing is when I got a notification saying my order couldn't be fulfilled  I couldn't get any more info. When I tapped the notification it opened the app but just took me to the restaurant's page where there was no mention of my order status. EDIT: changed my rating to 1 star and uninstalled the app because it isn't backed up by good service. Too many instances of drivers not bothering to read house numbers and going next door. Other delivery companies have no trouble at all.,a good app only bad thing i got notification saying order could i could get when i notification app took restaurant page mention order status edit rating star uninstalled app backed good service too many read house going next door other delivery trouble

These people seem to think that they can change the service policies and stick it to their customers when they feel like it. Demand quality from them  otherwise they wont give it to you.

This is my 1st time using the app. So i had to try and figure out how to apply my giftcard. That part could have been a little easier. It sucks that there's a service fee and delivery fee and it changes depending on your total.... Not cool. Plus  if your order is less than $20( small order fee)  you're charged a $4. That's crazy. Not sure if i'll be using this service again.,this st time app so try figure apply that part could little easier it service fee delivery fee depending total not cool plus order less small order fee that crazy not sure service
Updated: Service and app functionality has really gone downhill. Local favorites dropping off the app  search function is highly inaccurate  and I keep getting suggestions only to get notified they're out of range AFTER adding food to my cart and attempting to check out.

There is no way to quickly resolve an issue if an item was left off the order. The restaurant cannot do anything  and there is no way to reach Uber immediately. We were told we would have to go get the item. If we wanted to do that we wouldn't have ordered delivery. When Uber finally responded 5+ hours later  we asked for a full refund from Uber (because the item that was left off was the only reason we ordered from Uber & this restaurant)  but Uber refused. We'll never use Uber again.,there way quickly resolve issue item left order the restaurant anything way reach immediately we told would go get item if would ordered delivery when finally later full refund item left reason ordered restaurant we never use

I honestly didnt expect much but I recieved a message back in under 2 hours! They had already refunded all the items i was missing and even added cash for my next order. Honestly mistakes happen all the time   but its how those mistakes are rectified that shows how bright a business truly shines  from the top down,i ordered large meal day busy i received less half meal i obviously i eats immediately i honestly didnt expect much i message back they already missing even added cash next order honestly happen time rectified bright business truly top

This is one awful business. We had problems and they would not help out. They took the money out but would not refund the money that is owed to us. No customer support whatsoever. Robbing liars. Not happy and have contacted customer services so many times with a promise they will sort it out  to then be sent out an automated response that echoes the last naff message they sent us. Poor customer services!,this one awful business we would help they took money would refund money us no customer support whatsoever robbing not happy customer many times promise sort sent response last message sent us poor customer
The worst food ordering i have ever used. I accidentally ordered from ubereats. Once the order was plced there was no option to cancel it. So i contacted the cuastomer support within 2mins. I even told him immediately that this is urgent please cancel quickly on my behalf  the cust. guy took the order reference and asked me wait while he cancels. He actually made me wait 5mins and then said the restaurant has already prepared the food and refusal would add negative balance. Never using ubereats.,the worst food ever used i accidentally ordered once order option cancel so support within mins i even told immediately urgent please cancel quickly behalf guy took order reference wait he actually made wait mins said restaurant already prepared food refusal would add negative balance never

Rather use someone else😣,pathetic useless they eat ur money hour delivery guy ate money food second time around happening people rather use someone else persevering face
First time I used it and order was a disaster. Neither company would take responsibility and Uber's support is farcical  robotic responses and no refund policy so uninstalled. Won't use again!,first time i used order disaster neither company would take responsibility support farcical refund policy uninstalled wo use
It's okay,it
Not a smart use of Uber eats. They need to connect drivers before orders are placed,not smart use eats they need connect
This app allowed me to make an order on a restaurant that wasn't open. I ordered the food at 5pm for delivery at 7-7.30pm. At 7.30pm the app tells me that the order was not received by the restaurant and it will be cancelled. I'll just use deliveroo next time.,this app make order restaurant open i ordered food pm delivery pm at pm app order received restaurant i use next time
Constantly have issues where a driver is supposed to pick it up and either never does or takes 30 mins to an hour to pick it up. Then I can't even Contact support about it by phone or message interface. No contact support option on the app or website. I placed an order through grubhub after waiting an hour for my food to be picked up  they managed to make it  pick it up and deliver and I still haven't gotten my ubereats order picked up 2 hrs later.,constantly driver supposed pick either never hour pick then i even contact support phone message interface no contact support option app i order waiting hour food picked make pick deliver i still gotten order picked later

not bad at all... I had one experience where I placed my order  and the restaurant rejected it stating they were already done with delivery for the night  but according to uber there was still a half hr to go  my money was taken and I had to wait a week for a refund. I called the restaurant and complained that uber had them listed as still delivering  the manager said on his end it wasn't so not his fault... it was very bothersome to say the least!,bad i one experience i order restaurant already done delivery night according still half go money taken i wait week refund i restaurant listed still manager said end fault bothersome say least

Got wrong ordered. Delivery guy never gave the right food. None of the food was mine. Never got my food. They expect me to reorder the food and pay again and tip the driver. Yeah no thanks. Uber eats never contacted. Food is left in the table no one wants to eat it. Because it's not what we ordered. Unable to find phone number to complain or the get our food corrected.

Terrible customer service. The restsurant didnt provide my second dinner order soI had to drive there and get it myself. Uber eats said they could only provide a $5 credit for the inconvenience  which wasnt enough to even cover the charge for the delivery that i ended up having to pick up myself. And then the $5 credit is only provided AFTER you pay full price. I would never recommend uber eats to anyone. They could definitely stand to learn from doordash. Full refunds provided for bad orders,terrible customer service the didnt provide second dinner order drive get eats said could provide credit inconvenience wasnt enough even cover charge delivery ended pick and credit provided after pay full price i would never recommend eats anyone they could definitely stand learn full provided bad

If you schedule an order and the restaurant goes offline in the interval before the order goes through  there is no notification. You'll only realise that something is wrong when you check the app when you think your order is taking too long to arrive. I've tried to inform the developers about this problem before  but the feedback system is too complicated.,if schedule order restaurant goes interval order goes notification you something wrong check app think order taking long arrive i tried inform problem feedback system complicated

Happy with the service. Thank you!,happy service thank
App lies about drivers available  but will not let you cancel an order without a fee even when no drivers are available but you are supposed to wait for two or three hours for an order to cancel itself???? And then your food is delivered ice cold because the restaurant has already prepared it when you sent the order in. This is two orders in a row that are either canceled or delivered two hours late  deleting app because they are making their money on fees when you cancel. SCAM.,app available let cancel order without fee even available supposed wait two three order cancel and food ice cold restaurant already prepared sent order this two row either two late app making money cancel scam

I'm a relatively tolerant fellow and have given Uber Eats a few chances before creating this review. The delivery drivers are fine. The restaurants however  are not only completely unregulated but also have a tendency to be poor quality. Any disput on this regarding refunds or complaints is silently ignored. There is no choice but to accept their terrible service. Choose a different app.,i relatively tolerant fellow given eats review the delivery fine the however completely unregulated also tendency poor quality any regarding silently there choice accept terrible service choose different app

Regardless of being acquired by Zomato  why on earth you are sending frequent updates for  I believe you already have put the page in app to redirect users to the Zomato on few releases back. Is that page is so memory intensive that you really need 30 MB size for the app? You have sent many updates after that. Moreover  you haven't updated your app information on play store yet.

McDonald's app leaves Alot 2b desired.. frustrating. Included in order 2 Quarter Pounders... App doesn't allow condiment changes for just 1 burger---they have 2b exactly the same. There's a few other bugs  otherwise app works pretty well  I'll keep using it... And providing feedback. Thank you for listening. & I hope you have a happy Valentine's Day that exceeds your expectations... 💓 😁,app leaves b desired included order quarter app allow condiment b exactly there otherwise app works pretty well i keep and providing feedback thank listening i hope happy valentine day beating heart beaming face smiling eyes
Happy with all my food deliveries so far,happy food far
Not happy about spending 45$ to eat something without napkins sauce or forks. I would blame the restraunt but it clearly says on your website that they do not need to include it unless requeated. But there was no option. I couldnt even let the driver know. I might sound petty but this is half ass and not worth the money.,not happy spending eat something without sauce i would blame clearly need include unless but option i even let driver know i might sound petty half ass worth money

Promotional discount offer ... we went through and picked many items for the cart only to find out that we were outside of the delivery range. Okay fine. But it didn't inform us that it was the promotion that was invalid it just informed us we couldn't order at all. Even though the store is only about 5 miles away. I had to cancel the order and try again that we could get the order we had already placed,promotional discount offer went picked many cart find outside delivery range fine but inform us promotion invalid informed us could order even though store away i cancel order try could get order already
Too many extra fees,too many extra

Set time delivery less than ideal. my meal was over an hour late. At 6pm I scheduled my dinner for 7:15pm delivery. the uber app did not start to process my order until after 7:45pm. my meal was finally delivered at 820pm. this is unacceptable. David Settimi,set time delivery less ideal meal hour late at pm i dinner pm delivery app start process order pm meal finally pm unacceptable

Terrible. There's an idea  let's make our customers wait over an hour for a meal  then cancel the order with zero explanation On Valentine's Day! And if that wasn't enough  let's make it impossible to contact us for help by making our app interface function incorrectly. Valentine's day ruined! This organization has gone down the toilet. I'm moving exclusively to door dash oh and now I'm going to lyft from now on too. Edit: restaurant has informed me driver stole my food and canceles the order.,terrible there idea let make wait hour meal cancel order zero explanation on valentine day and enough let make impossible contact us help making app interface function incorrectly valentine day ruined this organization gone toilet i moving exclusively door dash oh i going edit restaurant informed driver stole food order

I will not use Uber Eats again because my order was never delivered! I placed the order around 6 pm. The tracking showed it due to arrive by 6:35 pm the latest; the restaurant closes at 7 pm. When it got past 6:35  I called the restaurant. They said the driver never showed up. We tried calling the driver but he didn't answer. I ended up picking it up. I sent a note to Uber Eats feedback and haven't heard back from anyone. Not an apology  credit or anything! Very disappointed!!!,i use eats order never i order around the due arrive latest restaurant when got past i restaurant they said driver never we tried calling driver answer i ended i sent note eats feedback back anyone not apology credit anything very disappointed

Horrible consistency  50 50 chance you'll get your order. Drivers will cancel until your order is completely cancelled and your left waiting for over an hour for a 20 min delivery time that never shows up. Do not recommend for southern California in the slightest  go to a different service.

Honestly a terrible service. The prices of items can be inflated astonishingly high  the only option to cancel an order is calling an overseas call centre  and credits are applied in such an idiotic fashion. Not at checkout  not once getting a receipt  but after all this Uber Eats changes the charge on your Payment method to reflect credits used. Tempted to never use the service again.,honestly terrible service the inflated astonishingly high option cancel order calling overseas call applied idiotic fashion not getting receipt eats charge payment method reflect used never use service

Worst takeaway app available with non existent customer service. Our order was ordered twice yet we didn't click to order twice. Why would I order the exact same £30 order of kebab 1 minute later?!?! App is intentionally designed to steal more of your money. No option of speaking to someone in app too. Just FAQ and if you call outside app it just directs you to the FAQ in app instead of being put through to someone.,worst app available non existent customer service our order ordered twice yet click order twice why would i order exact order kebab minute later app intentionally designed steal money no option speaking someone app just call outside app app instead put someone

So the app can't order my food and says that I need update my billing system (?). Everything seemed fine to me so I tried to reach out to the Twitter page of Uber support and provided them with sufficient screenshots and details of the issue but they didn't respond or anything. So   3 things : 1) Multinational company with Crappy customer support. 2)The app's doesn't order my food even when I 'update' my billing system 3) I'm hungry and they ain't providing me any food :'),so app order food i need update billing system everything fine i tried reach twitter page support provided sufficient issue respond anything so multinational company customer support the app order food even i update billing system i hungry ai providing food

Food was 30mins later than expected  ice cold and missing my drink. I called uber eats customer service to cancel my order and I was placed on hold for 15 mins until they found my order.

The only two places i wanted food from uber eats doesnt provide service for. They have a spacific list. If your thinking of doing uber eats  consider this being your heads up.

Fed up with this. If the order is correct  and no traffic  and no other issue...yeah  that's fine. The minute delivery is delayed  items are incorrect or missing...well  good luck. No apologies  other than a canned response  and maybe refund of missing item. You pay a hefty delivery fee and an extra service charge...for what? If the service is poor  do they refund it? No. Refund all or part of delivery charge? No. Very poor. Profit focused business  with no sense of care for their customers.,fed if order correct traffic issue yeah fine the minute delivery incorrect missing well good luck no canned response maybe refund missing item you pay hefty delivery fee extra service charge if service poor refund no refund part delivery charge no very poor profit business sense care

It works pretty well. My main complaint is that it sometimes ignores your search to favor promoted items. Also  sometimes it will open up randomly when I start another app. Plus the rate this order is incredibly intrusive. Canceling an item can also be difficult. Other than that  it's a great way to try local foods you never heard of before.,it works pretty well my main complaint sometimes search favor also sometimes open randomly i start another app plus rate order incredibly intrusive item also difficult other great way try local never

Had a problem with my order  got wrong items and only partially completed burgers from mcD and tried to explain to Support. They refunded me only £0.80 haha I tried again to contact them and they asked me what happened again - and I told them and not even 1 minute later they replied with an automated message saying they decided not to refund me...

When it works it works (although sometimes barely) but when it doesn't  oh boy you're in for a treat. Terrible support  tells you to reach to the restaurant yourself instead.

PLEASE DON'T USE THIS APP. TRUST ME!Sometimes they do a good job. But the minute there is an issue they will become useless. Drivers steal your food  deliver to wrong addresses and sometimes eat your food. Sometimes just blatant fraud. Someone from UBER eats charged $800 on my debit card and I never even got a phone call. UBER eats will not offer assistance. Just a refund and $5 credit  whether you spend $20 or $200. The more you use UBER eats the more these types of things occur. BEWARE!,please don t use this app trust me sometimes good job but minute issue become useless steal food deliver wrong sometimes eat food sometimes blatant fraud someone eats debit card i never even got phone call eats offer assistance just refund credit whether spend the use eats occur beware

Awful  not worth the hassle with so many other better companies around. Deliver wrong order and refuse to refund. Had to spend so long to handle myself without uber  as they refused. Contacted restaurant directly who confirmed error and had to refund me directly. From someone who used this a lot I have an error in 1 in 5 orders. Talabat and others dont have the same error rate  and they fix it when it happens.,awful worth hassle many better around deliver wrong order refuse refund had spend long handle without restaurant directly confirmed error refund directly from someone used lot i error dont error rate fix

Unfortunately it is not as good as getting the food yourself. It can arrive sometimes freezing cold and yet there is nothing much that can be done about it. The worst culprit is macdonalds drinks spilling. Putting 2 lids on Dosent do much to stop it and the paper bag Dosent do much to prevent it from dripping onto your carpet or even running the risk of falling out the bottom,unfortunately good getting food it arrive sometimes freezing cold yet nothing much done the worst culprit much stop paper bag much prevent dripping onto carpet even running risk falling bottom
Everything used to be good but I recently got a gift card and used it for my Uber eats account. Any time I try to use the credits I have it either charges my account or just tells me I can't use my card. If I have credits I should be able to use it. There isn't even an option to use the credits you have instead of your actual card. No longer want this service.,everything used good i recently got gift card used eats account any time i try use i either account i use card if i i able use there even option use instead actual card no longer want service

Dear Uber Eats  I want you back in India 😢 Why did you sell yourself out to Zomato? We were your loyal customers.

I am full of regrets as this is my first time on Uber eats; I got my orders delivered in the most bizarre state with sand & crushed stones in the pizzas and all i thought was maybe the driver fell off his bike on his way to deliver  I ordered for 12 chicken wings but got 8 wings instead  it's pathetic as I did not get a customer satisfaction in the goods money I paid for. Utterly disappointed.,i full first time eats i got bizarre state sand crushed thought maybe driver fell bike way deliver i ordered chicken got instead pathetic i get customer satisfaction goods money i utterly disappointed

When it works  it's really nice. The worst aspect is having to wait for a driver. The app tells you the amount of time if there are drivers but the fact that good can be prepared and then sit and get cold because a driver hasn't accepted the order is terrible. The app leads you to believe you'll have the order in a certain amount of time but it could be way longer while waiting for a driver.,when works really nice the worst aspect wait driver the app amount time fact good prepared sit get cold driver accepted order terrible the app believe order certain amount time could way longer waiting driver
Terrible accountability. I waited almost an hour for the restaurant to finish my order and found that there was no way to speak to anyone about cancelling the order and getting my money back. Uber used to be great about refunding customers if something went wrong. It's a shame that they no longer seem interested in doing so.,terrible accountability i almost hour restaurant finish order found way speak anyone order getting money back used great something went wrong it shame longer seem interested

Unsurprisingly  the app is designed to make it difficult to call in a complaint. Additionally  whilenthey push the monthly pass that waives delivery fees - you're no longer able to access restaurants that were further away (that they charged higher delivery fees for). Worse  the restaurants aren't even filtered out of your choices. So if you spent a long chunk of time placing a large order  you only find out you wasted your time AFTER you try placing the order. It's a shameful bait & switch.,app designed make difficult call complaint additionally push monthly pass delivery longer able access away higher delivery worse even so spent long chunk time large order find wasted time after try order it shameful bait switch

Constantly have the issue where drivers will cancel my order. No call  text  or anything and cancel.

I hate the payment method because your order could be claimed by anyone since the delivery guys don't ask for no proof of identification during order delivery.

I called support immidiately and they put me on hold twice  then told me they were cancelling for me but i was a courtesy and they wouldn't do it in the future.

Delivery of unsafe  dangerous foods. Food is cold and soggy  but the cold drinks will be warm.

It is not uncommon to be missing items no matter what restaurant you ordered from. Tonight was the final straw. The driver left our meal on somebody else's front porch.

That didn't even come with in I'm sorry for the inconvenience.,it uncommon missing matter restaurant ordered tonight final straw the driver left meal somebody else front porch they even hand person when would finally offer refund within business days that even come i sorry inconvenience
Thus is more about how the app assigns deliveries rather than the app itself. I constantly get cold and soggy food because the app always assigns a bicycle to deliver my food  often the rider will also make another delivery along the way. It always takes upwards to an hour to receive my food  at which point is barely worth the wait and money. PLEASE give us an option to disable BICYCLE deliveries. I'd happily pay extra to get a car that comes straight to me.,thus app rather app i constantly get cold soggy food app always bicycle deliver food often rider also make another delivery along way it always upwards hour receive food point barely worth wait money please give us option disable bicycle i would happily pay extra get car comes straight

I've been using UBER EATS for over a year  on average once a week  sometimes more & the only problems tend to have been the food  (a handful of times) & only once with the delivery person.

But recently I redownloaded the app. (it's up to date) there is no option on the first page to sign in my account  there is only an option to get started with uber eats(create an account) I've defiantly looked the entire page theres nothing there apart from that with the option to put your phone number in (to create an account) which I did try and it recognised my email but just says that I'm already registered.,this app great dont get wrong i ordered times but recently i app date option first page sign account option get eats create account i defiantly entire page theres nothing apart option put phone number create account i try i already registered

Support is less than useless and not very helpful. I have made a mistake on a order which I was allergic to and I tried to contact support but their system didn't recognise my number. Then it was delivered I tried to contact support I waited on the line for 20 minutes and they said to use the app to get help as the order was delivered. I did do what they said but I but the said to make a new order and was useless. I never going to use uber eats ever again. Uninstalled,support less useless helpful i made mistake order i allergic i tried contact support system number then i tried contact support i line said use app get help order i said i said make new order useless i never going use eats ever uninstalled
Food frequently shows up LATE and COLD. The prices on uber have an upcharge and often cost more than they would if you visited the store. And let's not forget delivery and service fees. Not to mention by the time I get my food  my lunch break is already over because they are super late 80% of the time. And uber does nothing to compensate you for the delay  or the poor food quality. They just say take advantage of our rating system. Absolute WASTE of MONEY. Use GrubHub or Postmates.,food frequently late cold the often cost would store and let forget delivery service not mention time i get food lunch break already super late time and nothing compensate delay poor food quality they say take advantage rating system absolute waste money use

Be careful!!!!! They double charge!!!!! I don't know how to reply to your comment  Uber. I will write it here. First  you don't have any customer service e-mail or phone. The only e-mail I found told me to solve the problem through the app. The person in the app justified the payments I did with one credit card and never answered to why did you charge me unreasonable amounts to the other. So... the same day  I ate 6 times for a total amount of almost 80 euros. Yes  sounds reasonable.,be careful they double charge i know reply comment i write first customer service e mail phone the e mail i found told solve problem app the person app i one credit card never charge unreasonable so day i ate times total amount almost yes reasonable

Service keeps getting worse and worse  Minimum charges have been increased from 10$ to 15$s. Essentially making all orders cost more than 20$s at all times. Completely outrageous that I end up paying 24$s for a 12$ meal. At this rate I'll give up on using the service entirely. I'm willing to pay a bit extra for convenience but this is just robbery.,service getting worse worse minimum essentially making cost times completely outrageous i end paying meal at rate i give service entirely i willing pay bit extra convenience robbery

So uber eats has been good overall for someone working on the road but as I just found out... if your driver that is bring your food decides not to deliver your food  uber eats is like all well here is your money back try again with a different driver maybe it will work out better this time. Doing nothing to make it right by their customers. Dont expect hot food all the time either. Normally warm to cold because drivers will not only be taking your food and everyone elses at the same time.,so eats good overall someone working road i found driver bring food deliver food eats like well money back try different driver maybe work better time doing nothing make right dont expect hot food time either normally warm cold taking food everyone time

I like the app  it's reliable and I very much appreciate the people that deliver the order when they should be delivered  but sometimes it would be off coordination with the map and will end up confusing you and the person picking up your order (s).

Placed an order at 9 pm and my delivery kept getting delayed. Called the restaurant and they said the food is ready but uber is not sending a driver for some reason so I tried to use the support system. At 7 am they finally message me back and ask me if i want the order at that time. Not only I was charged for that order and they fail to recognize that  yesterday they charged me an additional 27 dollars for no reason. STAY AWAY from this app.,order delivery kept getting restaurant said food ready sending driver reason i tried use support system at finally message back ask want order time not i order fail recognize yesterday additional reason stay away app

This fee  that fee  every excuse to charge you more. Not to mention most of the time the delivery guy is a crazy toxic flake and not at all friendly. One time this black guy picked up my food  took a detour away from my home parked somewhere for like 10 minutes  probably to blaze one up. Seemed anal when he arrived simply because i asked him to come to the back door cause i cant hear the front door. It was barely worth it even when the service was really cheap. Im not paying for attitude.,this fee fee every excuse charge not mention time delivery guy crazy toxic flake friendly one time black guy picked food took detour away home somewhere like probably blaze one anal simply come back door cause cant hear front door it barely worth even service really cheap paying attitude

So why i had to pay for it,very bad when app giving promotional so ordered restaurant but told far zone so us order charge account it so pay
Worst app ever! I mistakenly ordered and wanted to cancel the order  but this worst app didn't even gave me an option for that!

Very bad support experience. One of my orders had missing items  support said I would get a refund but it never arrived. Furthermore  the only way to get support is through the app or webpage  no support phone. So  if you don't get your order right  buy something else to it anywhere else (for example  Just Eat) because you won't get help instantly  if you manage to get help... Overall  very bad experience. I would recommend Just Eat a thousand times over Uber Eats.,very bad support experience one missing support said i would get refund never furthermore way get support app support phone so get order right buy something else anywhere else example just eat get help instantly manage get help overall bad experience i would recommend just eat thousand times eats

Garbage Interface. Impossible to give an accurate location. It won't allow me to pick my location from a map. Edit: ...an option of pin-pointing... on map There is no such option. Edit2: Here's a solution. Go into the Uber Ride App  add a Favorite Place in your account. That tool does have the pick my location from a map feature. Once you set it up in the Uber Ride App  then it's available as a favorite location on the Uber Eats App. You have a UX problem there. Edit3: Dear customer support. You keep suggesting the same solutions that do not work. There is no option of pin-pointing your delivery address on the map. Try it yourselves before answering back. Try it out on the latest Uber Eats Android version. To give the full details I have Uber Ride and Uber Eats on the same phone and with favorite locations saved at Uber Ride. Somehow I think this is where your BUG is. But for God's sake  test it out before answering. I followed your instructions and there is no option to pin point. Also  read Edit2 for the only workaround I found.,garbage interface impossible give accurate location it allow pick location map edit option pin pointing map there option edit here solution go ride app add favorite place account that tool pick location map feature once set ride app available favorite location eats app you problem edit dear customer support you keep suggesting work there option pin pointing delivery address map try back try latest eats android version to give full i ride eats phone favorite saved ride somehow i think bug but god sake test i option pin point also read edit i found

Horrible company  they are thieves who should be ashamed of themselves. Never ordering from them again. I placed an order of 140 dollars and they brought me food that was cold and unsatisfying. I felt bad throwing out so I reheated it. Still didn't taste good. I asked for a refund but they claim their policies don't allow refunds but they are just cheating people out of their money for the mistakes they make.

The drivers suck. Food is always cold when Delivered. Would not recommend. As someone that works for the restaurants the company delivers for I can assure you they never come on time and will deliver you cold food. They sometimes take over 2 hours to come get the food in Plattsburgh NY. Will never recommend anyone use this service. You want fresh hot food just go to the restaurants yourself. Save the over priced delivery fees as well.,the suck food always cold would recommend as someone works company i assure never come time deliver cold food they sometimes take come get food will never recommend anyone use service you want fresh hot food go save priced delivery well

Good for when you want something besides pizza but it's prohibitively expensive. On top of delivery & service fees  there's an extra fee for orders under $15 (until recently it was $10). The user has no control over who the delivery person is  yet app doesn't always find the best match (i.e.large order given to someone on bike). So service can be unreliable. You can end up paying a lot of $$$ for not a lot of food & unpredictable service.There's cheaper  more reliable options for ordering out,good want something besides pizza prohibitively expensive on top delivery service extra fee recently the user control delivery person yet app always find best match e large order given someone bike so service unreliable you end paying lot lot food unpredictable service there reliable

Constantly fails  especially with promos.,constantly especially
DO NOT USE unless you want to be ripped off!! The food will arrive cold. The delivery will miss items you've ordered/deliver wrong items and they will refuse to return your money  which leaves you paying for items you never received and in effect paying for items you didn't order. When things work  it's fine (like anything else)  but if things are wrong  get ready for frustration  poor service  paying for wrong items ordered and getting blanket replies.,do not use unless want the food arrive cold the delivery miss ordered deliver wrong refuse return money leaves paying never received effect paying order when work fine like anything else wrong get ready frustration poor service paying wrong ordered getting blanket

The app works pretty good the only downside to it is their delivery drivers. I have had multiple orders show up that are wrong or missing parts or just gave me the wrong order because the drivers do not understand how to read English. I'm not saying this in a degrading. It makes it difficult for them to do their job right when they can't verify the information because of a language barrier.,the app works pretty good downside delivery i multiple show wrong missing gave wrong order understand read i saying degrading it difficult job right verify information language barrier

I was on lunch and less than a mile away but could not leave work. I had to cancel the order after waiting 1and one half hours. The cancellation charge to my credit card was over 11 dollars. Not my fault. The thing I wonder is did my sandwich wait that long and who got to eat my sandwich? I will not use them.,i order the restaurant could get driver the restaurant said half hour they kept the update came deliver around pm i lunch less mile away could leave work i cancel order waiting one half the cancellation charge credit card not fault the thing i wonder sandwich wait long got eat sandwich i use

Your app works  your service is criminal. After reporting a fast food place for forgetting to pack all my items  I cant go back to rate them. You simply remove the rating option for some reason.

The delivery fees are ridiculous for starters. The only thing about uber eats that's good is the convenience of having your food delivered. I made a mistake in my order  attempted to correct it and was charged $90 for chicken because I couldn't get in touch with the restaurant  over the phone. And when I tried to cancel through the app before the food was even picked up  the cancellation charge was $72. I cant wait to see how uber deals with this issue. Update to follow,the delivery ridiculous the thing eats good convenience food i made mistake order correct chicken i could get touch restaurant phone and i tried cancel app food even picked cancellation charge i cant wait see issue update follow

Okay so I placed an order and it got cancelled then they said my money would be ruined which didn't as well the uber driver was rude and unprofessional she was in a rush or things but it wasn't necessary to talk in that manner or give an attitude to the customer if they're going to choose to do this job then they must respect and contribute with it. I will be suggesting many more not to get this app it lacks so many things including help servers it's not very helpful and I'm not happy one bit!,i order got said money would ruined well driver rude unprofessional rush necessary talk manner give attitude customer going choose job must respect contribute i suggesting many get app many help helpful i happy one bit

Great app  just wish we had the option to adjust ratings. We rated a restaurant 3 stars because they were missing a bag of food and we couldn't get a hold of anyone.

Customer Service sucks  the app sucks  especially the promotion service. The promo says one thing and then when you try using the promo  it shows that it is over.

Usually does ok with food delivery  but the customer service is absolutely abysmal. Got a problem with your order? Forget about it - you'll be told to leave a review. Food cold and inedible? Too bad  you won't get that back and will still have to pay for food you couldn't eat as they spout Sorry  leave a review. It's not policy on rinse and repeat.

Got my order completely wrong. The restaurant said they would replace it  if uber sent a new driver. Uber told me I had to rebuy the whole 55$ order and then they would send the driver and refund me within 5-7 business days. So a 12 pizza with 3 toppings and a side of lasagna now came out to 113$...

The apps services where much better in the past. Whenever the restaurant would mess up your order they would refund you. Now there is no honestly to their system  they always tell you sorry  and do nothing about it. There is a standard that your food should arrive in  and when that's not kept  the restaurant should pay and Uber should assist with the process. But clearly Uber eats protect the restaurant at all costs even if it means that I was not provided with the items ordered. Worst Support.,the much better past whenever restaurant would mess order would refund now honestly system always tell sorry nothing there standard food arrive kept restaurant pay assist process but clearly eats protect restaurant even i provided ordered worst support

I find it difficult to query anything with Uber on the app,i find difficult query anything app
After using it three times for two different restaurants I am very impressed with ease of use and the wide variety of options  especially late nights when I really want to be able to get something to eat but not enough to drive anywhere myself. They charge for the delivery fees AND the service fees for the Uber as if I had taken the ride to go pick it up but saved me the hassle of doing just that! Always handoff at the car  they never get out and walk up. GREAT APP!!!,after three times two different i ease use wide variety especially late nights i really want able get something eat enough drive anywhere they charge delivery and service i taken ride go pick saved hassle always car never get walk great app

Bahhboom,
Terrible app.. i just tried this service for the first time and i am disappointed in the difficulties in placing a simple order. I got charged the wrong amount and i couldn't even start a chat or send an email. I had to google customer service who put me on hold 3 times only to tell me a supervisor will call me back in fifteen minutes. Which was 2 hours ago. Other services are much better and convenient. Ubereats disappoints unfortunately. Pay attention to your card charges for unauthorized fees,terrible app tried service first time disappointed simple order i got wrong amount could even start chat send i customer service put hold times tell supervisor call back fifteen which ago other much better convenient unfortunately pay attention card unauthorized

Unable to find restaurants that are available to others in the same household  looking to order at the same time. Yet if another address closer to the restaurant is put in  it's now found the restaurant. Is there a distance bias going on between different phone brands or operating systems?,unable find available household looking order time yet another address closer restaurant put found restaurant is distance bias going different phone operating
The worst app to order food from they cant help you if you put the wrong address they still take yoir money too,the worst app order food cant help put wrong address still take money
Awesome but bad at the same time lols spend to much money,awesome bad time spend much money
The app itself is okay function wise. But recently Ubereats added service fee which is ridiculous because when I contact customer service  they aren't helpful so I'm being charge a ridiculous amount and I would also need to tip the driver. So expect to throw $10-15 on just fees alone. Everything on the menu are also double the price.,the app function wise but recently added service fee ridiculous i contact customer service helpful i charge ridiculous amount i would also need tip driver so expect throw alone everything menu also double price

Used to be a very good app  but now everything just goes wrong. Had a problem with two of my last orderings while two of my friends had problems recently (one order for five people was delivered just for two in one of the instances). Also everything costs more now and there are very few promotions (most of those few are promotions to get the price you would pay without the app).,used good app everything goes wrong had problem two last two recently one order five people two one also everything get price would pay without app

I uninstalled the app after receiving an order that smelled like an ashtray. I got a non-committal response from uber customer service. They failed to acknowledge that it was a problem that their partner smoked in close proximity to my dinner. Offered a credit  but what I really wanted was to know that it was accepted as an issue and what steps would be taken to ensure it would not happen again.,i uninstalled app order smelled like i got non committal response customer service they acknowledge problem partner smoked close proximity dinner credit i really know accepted issue would taken ensure would happen
The app is counter intuitive in letting you select your delivery address  including reverting to a previous address if it has ANY kind of glitch  their customer support is a sham that doesn't listen  has difficulty understanding what you say unless you are using super simplified phrases  and they dont do anything if there is an issue and its on the app's end and not your own.,the app counter intuitive select delivery address previous address any kind customer support sham listen difficulty understanding say unless super simplified dont anything issue app end

I think what makes uber eats so great is all the Moorsish (black) people who brings me my food. They are very respectful and kind hearted when you come. I mean i respect and love all people.

Happy Negro month.,i think eats great black people food they respectful kind hearted come i mean respect love people but something people feel good bring food happy negro month

Update- feb 10  2020: I am done with Uber eats. Waited over an hour for my lunch. The driver never showed up to pick up my food. The app said the driver was arriving and the restaurant was wrapping up my order for over an hour. Called the restuarant they confirmed the driver never showed up. Couldn't have lunch. Uber eats offers me $5 credit towards my next order lol.

In my experience  the only way to reach a human working at the Uber company  is to write a bad review. And a bad review is rightly given. I have provided the requested confidential payment and identity card details  in turn you still have not authorised my payment card in your system despite I have purchased Uber products one million times using this card and use it all the time on your competitors services (while waiting for you to respond to my request).,in experience way reach human working company write bad review and bad review rightly given i provided confidential payment identity card turn still payment card system despite i one million times card use time waiting respond request

Couldn't get to a screen that allowed me to actually see restaurants. All I got was a screen to enter my location  and select when I wanted to deliver. Useless. Worse than useless. Edit to add: Found out that Uber Eats is not in Park City  which is where I was. The error message I got was unable to determine your location in the location screen. That doesn't exactly tell me that Uber Eats is not available in my location.,could get screen actually see all i got screen enter location select i deliver useless worse useless edit add found eats park city i the error message i got unable determine location location screen that exactly tell eats available location

I've used this app many a time and it's worked fine but recently I've had an extremely frustrating error message appear when placing an order. The app tells the me the location of the restaurant is too far but these are restaurants which are shown to me based on my address so I should be within the catchment area. Furthermore  I have placed orders multiple times at these restaurants and had no trouble so why all of a sudden am I getting the same message for each of them?

Plz read it for once for your own benefit. I suggest not to download it. Because when you order food you need to pay tax and delivery fee. And any discount is hardly found and u can rarely use it .

That's why I would like to suggest to not to use this app. Other apps is much better than it.,read benefit i suggest because order food need pay tax delivery fee and discount hardly found u rarely use other better find found discount also enjoy delivery free food that i would like suggest use app other much better

You can't change the delivery adress if you put a wrong one. That's the most useless food app I've ever used. More than that  they don't even have a live chat section in order to discuss with them to manually change the delivery adress. P. S. The driver isn't allowed to deliver to the new adress if you want to change it afterwards. Thats uber eats policy,you change delivery put wrong one that useless food app i ever used more even live chat section order discuss manually change delivery p s the driver deliver new want change afterwards thats eats policy

I didnt receive half of my order. The driver and car wasnt the one in the picture and to top it off they seemed like they weren't sober. The food I did have was freezing and I got another ladies soda choice. because they did multiple orders and sent the driver to a location way on the other side of town first when I was a four min drive away.

Tipping at the completion based on the performance of the delivery  would be cordial. Also the first screen is quite jarring.A wide variety of assortments  choices  pictures  and words all at once. Making it quite difficult to navigate  almost overwehlming.Visually the similarities of the free delivery choices vs recently ordered  vs the rest(in color font structure layout text boxes)makes them quite confusing.You almost become lost in the wide variety of choices without differentiating.,tipping completion based performance delivery would cordial also first screen quite jarring a wide variety making quite difficult navigate almost visually free delivery recently ordered rest color font structure layout text quite you almost become lost wide variety without

I put my location on because it told me to  and it sent it to my last address in a different state. I called the driver to cancel it  and I can't get a refund because they already made it.

used to use it for lunch all the time but the new fee set up is not single order friendly.

My number one issue with this app is the lack of notification about when an order gets canceled. So many times when I'm working and I schedule a delivery for when my break is  I'll be left waiting  go look at what's up  and see it's been canceled. No email  no push notification  nothing. I can't order again because my break is when it is  so I'm left with no food. Fix this. I should get a notification telling me what's up  not just the order disappearing off my app with no explication.,my number one issue app lack notification order so many times i working i schedule delivery break i left waiting go look see no push notification nothing i order break i left food fix i get notification telling order disappearing app explication

They make you pay for the delivery  not talking about the 8.99 regular delivery. I'm saying they make you pay for that  plus like 20% fee and then ask for a tip.

UberEats was great until the most recent changes in pricing. In the new version of the app  tips are included and cannot be edited. You might as well call it a delivery fee. Taxes and fees are not covered by promotions. Why? It's also glitchy and doesn't remember my payment info. Furthermore  I cannot even place an order  so it's useless. Back to Doordash.,great recent in new version app included you might well call delivery fee covered why it also remember payment furthermore i even place order useless back

Took my money but did not receive my order. Phone calls and so called live chat have not resolved the problem.

Note that if your order takes over an hour (fault being with restaurant)  UberEats will not cancel the order unless if you want to be charged for it. After my second try with a different agent  having had waited almost two hours for my order was the order cancelled with no charge.

They have dramatically increased prices.

Always on-time  always exactly what is ordered. Perfect when you need food in a pinch  or when you just wanna have a lazy day and stay home.

So most things are way over priced to begin with 2 dollar sandwichs are 6 dollars ? I don't think so .Then a blatant slap in the face comes when the ask for you to add a tip for what service may I ask .If you choose not too tip automatically your charged 2.99 . Here's the kicker. There's a delivery fee a service fee then tax. These charges add $10 to your order. If you order small orders these fees are higher. They make it to either way if you buy anything  you're paying $10 for using this app.,so way priced begin dollar i think then blatant slap face comes ask add tip service may i ask if choose tip automatically here kicker there delivery fee service fee tax these add order if order small higher they make either way buy anything paying app

Poor customer service. I have made several orders with them and they get it wrong every time so far and even items are missing.

Straight up robbery. If you don't answer their phone call they straight up cancel your order no food or refund. What kind of delivery driver sits in their car waiting for you answer their phone. Couldn't leave my food at the door could? And they purposefully made the app so you can't contact the uber driver after the cancel. This company is a leech in every respect. Would not recommend.,straight robbery if answer phone call straight cancel order food refund what kind delivery driver car waiting answer phone could leave food door could and purposefully made app contact driver cancel this company leech every respect would recommend

I had frozen food delivered and contacted ubereats about it literally within 5 minutes after speaking w/ the store manager. They said they would look into it and get back at me. A week goes by and I get no update. I email them just to be told they cant do anything about it or credit me back. $40.33 on 3 meals for 2 co workers and myself wasted for frozen food to be delivered at an office and be thrown away. DONT USE THEM!! GO TO DOORDASH!!,i frozen food literally within speaking w store manager they said would look get back a week goes i get update i told cant anything credit back wasted frozen food office thrown away dont use them go to

Easy to use and accurate tracking. Good variaty and they deliver until late. Update :as of 2020 its absolutely shhhhh!!!! Something had definitely changed and it's for the worst. The app Is only available when it wants to and only for certain orders! It was decent enough before but now it simply shait and unacceptable!!! Wake-up uber what are you thinking!?!?

Most of the time is good service. However I have had issues. A few weeks ago I tried to order dominos through uber eats to an apartment I was staying at  the ETA display malfunctioned and stayed on processing order  significant amount of time went by  I then was unable to cancel the order. The eta went to delivered over an hour later and I was charged for pizza I never received! Raised a dispute for it and never heard anything back nor a refund/ credit.,most time good service however i a ago i tried order eats apartment i eta display stayed order significant amount time went i unable cancel order the eta went hour later i pizza i never received raised dispute never anything back refund credit

Misclicked on order and refunding would only give back like $6 of my $28 order even though I tried to refund immediately,order would give back like order even though i tried refund immediately
Uber eats needs a check and balance system. Since there is an upcharge on the food  a delivery and service charge  the orders should be on point. To have several items missing is totally unacceptable. I am rethinking using Uber eats. It's not worth the hassle,eats needs check balance system since food delivery service charge point to several missing totally unacceptable i eats it worth hassle

One night a young lady brought me a sandwich but the zombie ninjas  trolls  and mutant coyotes tried to rush us. Luckily she had her sword and between that  a hardhat and screwdriver we beat them back to the swamp. Later we split the sandwich and tended to each others wounds from the fierce combat. Ive never met a driver like that since  and I think of her often...,i work steel mill way middle nowhere its hour shift pm scary one night young lady brought sandwich zombie mutant tried rush us luckily sword screwdriver beat back swamp later split sandwich wounds fierce combat never met driver like since i think often

Just tried my first order on Uber eats. I paid $23 for 3 meals at McDonald's - filet o fish  big Mac  and 2-cheesburger  with fries and white milks. Instead  they brought 3 chocolate milks and 3 fries  and zero sandwiches. I tried to contact Uber and there was no phone number  and no chat. I tried to call McD's and Uber didn't have a phone number for them. My wife has used Door Dash 4 or 5 times a week for years with no issues. Irritated having wasted $20. Back to Door Dash.,just tried first order eats i filet fish big mac white instead brought chocolate zero i tried contact phone number chat i tried call phone number my wife used door dash times week wasted back door dash

Awsome,
I advise everyone to not use this app. These guys don't care about customers at all. My order was cancelled by the delivery driver for no reason. I found out through a Google search that it's a quick scam by the drivers to get free food. I better get my refund back! Most pathetic app. How does tech company still exist if they can't fix this loophole.,i advise everyone use app these care my order delivery driver reason i found search quick scam get free food i better get refund back most pathetic app how tech company still exist fix loophole

Thanks Uber!,one your stole order you help anything big whoop refund order received but extra effort fix something hired driver i see f rating allow your customer service what supporting anyway company expense thanks

I have used this app for a couple years to receive food delivery mostly without issue. I decided today I would become a delivery driver. In the app there is an option to become a delivery driver in account settings. I clicked the link  chose a city  read through the terms and conditions and selected continue. That's where the process ends. The app goes no further. I scrolled up and down  side to side to see if I missed a checkmark button. Nope. The continue button is dead.

Meal delivery is supposed to be convenient to the consumer. That's why we pay all the fees. So it's pretty frustrating when the delivery driver picks up your food from down the block only to take it halfway across town to other deliveries he has waiting already. Then they drop off your soggy cold food  late and expecting a tip.,meal delivery supposed convenient consumer that pay so pretty delivery driver food block take halfway across town waiting already then drop soggy cold food late tip

Unable to log in or reach customer support. I got a new phone and when I try to sign in there is no where to enter my password. Then when I try to contact support it tells me it's an unmonitored email. Well why is it listed then as the support team? Update: I have gotten the same automated message 5 times even after asking to speak to someone higher up. Your support system is a joke and will never use Uber eats again.

Pretty good app  usefull  but I can't change the address or know how to cancel the order and/or check what's the address of the orders and I have made the mistake of using an old order to make a new one without knowing it was to a different address and so I was left without a way to fix it.

For the love of god  can your developers please allow us to pinpoint our location on the map! This makes the app very frustrating because I always have to call the courier and give them instructions. The original uber app allows you to pinpoint your exact location but the Uber Eats app does not. Please add this option and I will rate 5 stars. *****Update 2/8/2020**** The option of pinpointing is still not there. Bad support.

The app has become semi- reliable and useful for a one stop shop for takeaway. I've found Customer Service to vary from person to person. The estimated wait time can be a little ambitious and the delivery charge just increased so its certainly not something you'd use every week. The higher Delivery charge has become a nusience as I had gotten used to the Lower one (which was already a bit much). If there was one spot that I'd improve  it would be lowering that.,the app become semi reliable useful one stop shop i found customer service vary person person the wait time little ambitious delivery charge certainly something would use every week the higher delivery charge become i gotten used lower one already bit much if one spot i would improve would lowering

The whole experience was good however Uber eats sent me a deal off my first purchase and yet did not apply it to my bill in the end. It's was 500 off my very first bill:(. I wonder if in the reviews u can add a field to custom write rather Chan only choose options of being unprofessional etc. As the fellow who came to deliver didn't come with change for cash payment. And therefore he returned with a hefty tip which wasn't even planned :( In the end food was good and delivery was on time:),the whole experience good however eats sent deal first purchase yet apply bill end it first bill i wonder u add field custom write rather choose unprofessional as fellow came deliver come change cash payment and therefore returned hefty tip even in end food good delivery time

Eats Pass is a scam. It is worded in a misleading way  implying that all delivery will be free. This implication is emphesized by the removal of delivery costs from the restaurant selection menu. All delivery is not free  however. This promotion is misleading by design. I am also no longer offered free delivery on nearby orders  a consequence which was not mentioned in the pass description. And the 15% off only applies to the taxes/fees  not the order cost. Very slimy. Lost a customer. Uninstal.,eats pass scam it worded misleading way delivery free this implication removal delivery restaurant selection menu all delivery free however this promotion misleading design i also longer free delivery nearby consequence pass description and order cost very slimy lost customer

Entregadores muito  muito ruins  no geral.,
I used too use Uber eats a lot. Spent a lot of time using it in 2019. It helps with hunger cravings and such. The problem is. I spent 2 months missing food or missing items. Sometimes I didn't report it because I didn't care for refunds. I used to like Uber Eats but this is just ridiculous. I'm just gonna use Door Dash. I had to edit this because I was actually missing 8/10 of the meal. I'm so sick of this!!,i used use eats lot spent lot time it hunger the problem i spent missing food missing sometimes i report i care i used like eats ridiculous i use door dash i edit i actually missing meal i sick

Unprofessional  worst experience and worst customer service. Use this app if you want to wait for your food for 2 hours  not being able to cancel it or reach the customer service  and then the food never arrives. And the compensation for all this wasted time? A discount on the delivery fees for my next order!

The biggest issue is missing food  it's something I can handle but telling your child that there Saturday night treat  is missing the part they wanted the most isn't good. The drivers should be checking what is going into the order and ensure it matches what has been ordered.,the driver time i love fact i see app food cold the biggest issue missing food something i handle telling child night treat missing part good the going order ensure ordered

Uber eats is excellent! Always receive great service. However  the fees are outrageous! Why would you charge a delivery fee AND a service fee  then have the AUDACITY to ask for a F*****G tip. I understand service is not easy at all. There I like to tip. But after a $15 order turns into $25  I have no motivation to tip. I hope the drivers are benefiting from all those ungodly fees because my tip game with uber eats is very small. 🤨,eats excellent always receive great service however outrageous why would charge delivery fee and service fee audacity ask f g tip i understand service easy there i like tip but order turns i motivation tip i hope ungodly tip game eats small face raised eyebrow

Sorry guys  food service is not the business for you. This requires a customer service who can be contacted. There is no tradeoff between cost savings and customer service.

This issue of combining order deliveries is not on. It would be prudent practice to first ask the customer whether they would like their delivery combined with another in order to decrease delivery costs. Maybe have a Yes/No option on the order confirmation page. Since this thing started my orders are all arriving over an hour late and cold. Make us choose for ourselves whether we want to trade in fast and quality service for a mere R5 cost cut  not force it on us.,this issue combining order it would prudent practice first ask customer whether would like delivery combined another order decrease delivery maybe yes no option order confirmation page since thing hour late cold make us choose whether want trade fast quality service mere r cost cut force us

I think this app is great but when it comes to promotions it is not so great. Seems almost as if I'm about to get a promotion  the app is 'malfunctioning' or the card is unusable. The app states if I refer a friend I get 20 dollars when they order for the first time  awesome right? Well  I referred 3 friends  received 20 from each but then I wasn't allowed to get anymore? Why not? It's a way to get more customers so why limit it? I havent seen any print online saying there is a limit.,i think app great comes great almost i get promotion app card unusable the app i refer friend i get order first time awesome right well i received i get why it way get limit i havent seen print saying limit

Don't waste your time with this app! I had 3 people all on different phones trying to place an online order and every time we went to add our payment it said there was an error.

I ended up ordering on GrubHub even though they didn't have the restaurant we wanted.,do waste time app i people different trying place order every time went add payment said error i common issue i tried different different and different nothing worked i ended even though restaurant

Ripped off. Never using again  never received an order and uber eats cancelled it. I was assured I'd get a refund within 10 days. Waited 15... nothing and was told to go to my bank about it.... 6 weeks later i got a refund by going through my bank to appeal it. Finally gave up and wanted to try again..... Got told i need to pay outstanding amount...for the cancelled order..... before I can order again. Thank goodness for Menulog and Deliveroo and All the other reliable delivery apps.,never never received order eats i assured i would get refund within days nothing told go bank later got refund going bank appeal finally gave try got told need pay outstanding amount order i order thank goodness all reliable delivery

This service has become a money hungry joke. Apparently orders less than $15 incur a $3 small order fee (it used to be less than $10) and the drive share free delivery option is only for orders that are at least $20  which  if you're ordering for one  is probably more than what your delivery fee will end up being anyway. Postmates it is then,this service become money hungry joke apparently less incur small order fee used less drive share free delivery option least one probably delivery fee end anyway

Terrible! Why wait almost an hour to cancel the order and refund my money! If I could give 0 stars I would. Ridiculous  especially when app said the Uber driver had already picked up the order. immediately ordered same food from Door Dash. Save yourself the headache and hunger pains and use GrubHub or DoorDash or even a smaller  local service. I can't even call and complain with UberEats. Just so angry,terrible why wait almost hour cancel order refund money if i could give i would ridiculous especially app said driver already picked order immediately ordered food door dash save headache hunger use even smaller local service i even call complain just angry

My orders have turned up incomplete a number of times. So I have at to go through a long messaging process to get my money back for my items missing. But tonight was the last straw. I ordered 3 meals and one happy meal .Ended up being delivered one meal and my drinks. And uber eats have told me that due to me having previously complained about the incomplete orders .They are not going to give me a refund for the food that was missing. This is disgusting. Need to find out my rights.,my turned incomplete number times so i go long process get money back missing but tonight last straw i ordered one happy meal ended one meal and eats told due previously incomplete they going give refund food missing this disgusting need find

Food wasn't delivered. Deliverer could 'accidentally' mark as completed and I couldn't contact the driver after that point. App puts up interface to tip driver after  which is totally inappropriate when your order just got incorrectly completed. Had to jump through hoops to find someone to talk to to get food or a refund. Its impossible to navigate back to an open help chat. Just a bad experience overall and the design of the app contributed to this.,food deliverer could accidentally mark i could contact driver point app interface tip driver totally inappropriate order got incorrectly had jump find someone talk get food refund its impossible navigate back open help chat just bad experience overall design app
Ruim. Perde de 10 a 0 para os concorrentes. Além de o layout ser ruim e pouco intuitivo  ele mente no preço da entrega. Quando eu vejo o restaurante é um preço  no carrinho é outro.,de para os de layout ser e da eu um

Great. Happy with app and overall service,great happy app overall service
This app is awesome for ordering food. Most of the time it works out perfectly. It would be nice if they could give better estimations for the time delivery though  as to maybe include how far away the restaurant is from your address. It's not really ideal when they give a 35 minute approximation for delivery when you come to realize the restaurant is 30 minutes away...receiving cold food and feeling more inclined to tip better for the length of driving the driver endures.,this app awesome food most time works perfectly it would nice could give better time delivery though maybe include far away restaurant address it really ideal give minute approximation delivery come realize restaurant away cold food feeling tip better length driving driver

Originally says 20-30 mins for delivery. Then I placed an order and it jumped to an hour. Then the est delivery timer started adding a min about every 10 seconds. Was going to be charged to cancel the order. Tried very hard to find a way to contact Uber for an hour and couldn't find anything. The restaurant gave me a number to call. Uber canceled my order and returned my money but it's been about 1.5 hrs and I not been able to get lunch. Immediately deleted the app.,originally delivery then i order hour then delivery timer min every was going cancel order tried hard find way contact hour could find anything the restaurant gave number call order returned money i able get lunch immediately app

Terrible. It never lets me even order. There needs to be a check for delivery distance BEFORE you actually order food. And in this case I'm definitely close enough to order.

It's so dumb how I can order from a restaurant on skip the dishes but not on Uber eats. If skip was open sooner I'd only use skip. For example one restaurant that is available on skip the dishes will not be available on Uber eats. I also work literally 5 minutes away from my house and Uber eats will deliver to my office but not my house that is even sometimes closer than the office to the restaurant.

I had a $20 cash tip ready for the driver too!! UPDATE: Tried it for a second time because they gave me a 15 dollar off coupon. My order was a lot earlier than last time. But alas my order still got canceled. Do not try until maybe a few years down the road and the figured this out better!,waste time do even my first order come it kept back got what hell kind service i cash tip ready driver update tried second time gave dollar coupon my order lot last time but alas order still got do try maybe road figured better

Finely found that option under the help option and pressed cancel my order and it was buffering the whole time and then I contacted the driver and advised him that I was not done.

Crapy company  you know you SUCK when there is no way to contact said company. Stop ruining business reputations because the users are stupid. Ice melts morons.

Uber Eats coverage area currently cuts off about half a mile from my house in Upminster About 75% of the town is covered  but not my road. It's been coming soon for months. The cut off border appears to be completely arbitrary  as some parts of the same road are in coverage  while some are not !,eats coverage area currently half mile house about town covered road it coming soon the cut border completely arbitrary road coverage

If it's delivered  it's great! I've had orders pending for almost an hour and all of a sudden get canceled. I had one order cancel  I call the store and they said they had no idea why it was cancelled  the driver had picked up my order. Customer service apologizes but that's it. I rate orders  half the time missing something and never get reimbursed for that or for wasting an hour waiting on food and then it getting cancelled. Doordash is way better and reimburses you for poor service.,if great i pending almost hour sudden get i one order cancel i call store said idea driver picked order customer service i rate half time missing something never get wasting hour waiting food getting way better poor service

The app puts a random adress. Got my delivery in a wrong adress. And there was no way to find any instant support or help from the app. So technically there were no solutions. And also the app said i will be next time charged for no-shows. Despite the fact that I talked to my delivery guy who was  so nice and tried to help but he was helpless. Oh yeah  and such a disapointment  there is no functioning email to contact those who refuse to truly help. The app itself never showed any help.,the app random got delivery wrong and way find instant support help app so technically and also app said next time despite fact i delivery guy nice tried help helpless oh yeah contact refuse truly help the app never help

Not a great selection still and you pay extra via uber eats to use the same takeaways other apps also use. Biggest issue is nothing ever arrives within the advertised time  the uber eats delivery service is very poor and always late  often substantially. Getting customer service via the app seems purposefully long and difficult. My last 2 orders from McDonald's were quoted as 15-25mins and arrived 1hr 30mins later  that is not an operational delay  that is poor implementation of sevice.,not great selection still pay extra via eats use also use biggest issue nothing ever within time eats delivery service poor always late often substantially getting customer service via app purposefully long difficult my last mins hr mins later operational delay poor implementation

Tonight  I'll be eating.... nothing! Order: #EAA38 I placed an order at approximately midday with the promise of a 12:40pm delivery. It is now 9:14pm with the app still trying to find a driver.

I've called uber eats 4 times in total and emailed twice but keep getting bounced around.

Don't use the app if you're going to use a Visa debit card  they'll take money from your account days after you've already paid.

Good app and good selection of choices  however the ~20% food cost markup and delivery fees are brutal. What would have cost maybe $15 in-person takeout ends up being almost $30 after delivery fees and item cost increases! Free delivery and promos are ok time to time  but it's not dependable and is far outweighed by surcharges...,good app good selection however food cost markup delivery brutal what would cost maybe person almost delivery item cost free delivery time time dependable far

No one from Uber reads your problem  they simply just resend you the form you've already submitted when you requested help the first time.. but again how am I supposed to give you the email and card information associated with my cellphone number if I NEVER CREATED THE ACCOUNT. Therefore it would be impossible for me to give you information I do not have? I'm sure the person who used to have my number created the account. Developer: go for help. Help: ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!!!,no one problem simply resend form already help first time i supposed give card information associated number i never the account therefore would impossible give information i i sure person used number account developer go help help absolutely useless
Used to be a great app  but as their delivery price went up the customer support went down. Upon showing evidence of missing items from an order they couldn't provide a full refund.

So I will never use Uber Eats or Uber EVER again. Their system has apparently been down since this morning but they are still taking orders. Was told to call back in an hour to get a refund but not sure I believe them. No call from Uber to notify of the outage and why is their app still up and running when their system is down? NOT IMPRESSED  NEVER AGAIN!,so i never use eats ever their system apparently since morning still taking was told call back hour get refund sure i believe no call notify outage app still running system not never again

The attitude of delivery boy is very rude. Its nt a personal issue with him. I want to explain my experience with uber eats is very bad. I ordered minimum 4 to 5 times . All the orders are undeliverable to me bcz of many excuse made by delivery boy. I appreciate there hard work but i didn't understand their attitude. 1 delivery boy reached my place to deliver the food .

Works fine. I'm just surprised that there isnt a mandatory way to make users choose which address to deliver to. The little you're far away reminder doesn't always pop up. Making users pick an address before delivery can stop a lot of problems before they start. Heck even amazon makes you choose an address before buying unless you have 1 click settings on.,works fine i mandatory way make choose address deliver the little far away reminder always pop making pick address delivery stop lot start heck even choose address unless click

How does clearing the cache remove camera access and the other abusive permissions it asks for?,old work still many mandatory unreliable also new version needs camera access stays running background edit read review either how clearing cache remove camera access abusive
It's to my liking  really easy and simpke,it liking really easy
Man  now my money was taken  and my food not arrived,man money taken food
In a $85 order with free delivery by the restaurant  they charge me $23.50 as a fee (total $108.50). Really? Other apps do a MUCH better job. Other than the outrageous fee of more than 25% of my order  the app works fine and has an easy to use interface  but that is not enough when you have other options doing the same and charging you a third of what Uber Eats does.,in order free delivery restaurant charge fee total really other much better job other outrageous fee order app works fine easy use interface enough charging third eats
Excellent,excellent

Pathetic customer service unless you don't report bad service.,pathetic customer service unless report bad service
I ordered about $40 worth of food at around 2:40 AM. The app told me it would arrive latest time by 3:30 AM.. the food got to my house around 4:15 AM and it was absolutely disgusting.. I order about $1000 of uber eats a month and almost never complain and they refused to give me a credit or return my money for a meal that was disgusting because of their error... crappy place.,i ordered worth food around am the app told would arrive latest time am food got house around am absolutely disgusting i order eats month almost never complain give credit return money meal disgusting error place
I ordered food and had to go collect it myself because apparently Uber drivers don't drive in the rain,i ordered food go collect apparently drive rain
Nice one no complain,nice one complain
Easy to use.You can find what Your look for,easy use you find your look
I will never use again. First let's just say that it took my order 2 hours to be picked up. I myself ended up picking up my order before my Uber Eats driver. The great thing about it is ubereats did refund my money so I'm very appreciative of that. I hope that this can be resolved in better time management thank you and have a great day.,i never use first let say took order picked i ended order eats driver the great thing refund money i appreciative i hope resolved better time management thank great day
Pointless  they emailed me offering me a deal to sign up and then tell me they dont cover my area.,pointless offering deal sign tell dont cover area
After couple of orders which I made before I was satisfied with the result and service until last two orders which I paid with tips and never get my food delivered... After spending an hour to try to fix the issue when I supposed to eat already to get your money back. I don't know what's wrong with drivers get the food and never show up. Absolutely ridiculous.,after couple i made i satisfied result service last two i never get food after spending hour try fix issue i supposed eat already get money back i know wrong get food never show absolutely ridiculous
Over time. The customer service has taken a massive nose dive. Sick of the bad service. I am deleting the app. Have been ordering food for a number of years now. But it is clear that it is better I take my business somewhere else. Thank you for the violent illness from the last delivery. And your complete disregard for my health or satisfaction as a customer.,over time the customer service taken massive nose dive sick bad service i app have food number but clear better i take business somewhere else thank violent illness last delivery and complete disregard health satisfaction customer
Easy!,easy
Sell outs😒,sell unamused face
You need to scan your card to verify your account. But 0 options if it won't scan your card.,you need scan card verify account but scan card
After an hour and a half wait for an order to arrive due to their system failing and not finding a new driver after the original cancelled  they wont even offer a refund or compensation. Done using this app and having this happen to me. Just use SkipTheDishes or DoorDash instead.,after hour half wait order arrive due system failing finding new driver original wont even offer refund compensation done app happen just use instead
It's easy to use. I like the free delivery options every 15 minutes.,it easy use i like free delivery every

Very bad  I can't access the site because my email is already registered and it won't let me go further,very bad i access site already registered let go
I adored this service until i learned that your charged full price even if your food is wrong  half eaten or doesnt even show up. There is no way to resolve these situations  you cannot get any employee on the phone and it is frustratung beyond words to not get what you ordered and still have to pay. There needs to be a way to handle complaints overcharges and no shows.,i service learned full price even food wrong half eaten doesnt even show there way resolve get employee phone beyond get ordered still pay there needs way handle
The app itself is fine  but they moved to using bicycles which leaves food cold. Missing items on orders also has become a problem  we used this app for a long time to get food now searching for other options.,the app fine leaves food cold missing also become problem used app long time get food searching
Bad experience every time they change the delivery time with no customer service to talk with and this is not the first time Really shame on uber,bad experience every time change delivery time customer service talk first time really shame
Be warned  no safe gards against fraud. Had a very very bad experience with the application and support is poor for South African Users 0/10 would use again.,be safe fraud had bad experience application support poor south would use

Stole my money  it's better to actually go to the restaurant than pay a service fee and never receive part of your order. Customer service is a joke but it's slightly better than other ordering apps. Slightly being the keyword here.,stole money better actually go restaurant pay service fee never receive part order customer service joke slightly better slightly

Customer service is a joke. If there is an issue from their side  don't count on them helping. They'll just tell you to try again or use their website instead of the app. Use corporate guidelines as an excuse to dismiss you.,customer service joke if issue side count helping they tell try use instead app use corporate excuse dismiss

You should probably worry about your thousands of sexual assaults that occur in your Ubers a year  just here in the US alone  but when you have time  please fix your janky website and password recovery system. It gives no option to recover by email  all I wanted was some damn Starbucks for breakfast and my car isn't available today. I no longer have the phone or number I used to. Thanks for nothing. Back to Grubhub & Doordash I go  they allow password recovery by email. I won't be returning to UberEats or Uber.,you probably worry sexual occur year us alone time please fix password recovery system it option recover i damn breakfast car available today i longer phone number i used thanks nothing back i go allow password recovery i

I was just browsing tha app and trying to look for a meal to order then suddenly there was a note popped up that the order was succesfully placed and on its way. I quickly called the restaurant to cancel as it is not the order I wanted but they instructed me to call ubereast. I called ubereats and they informed me it can be cancelled but I will be charged cancellation fee as the order was placed already. You shoud check your application why it's suddenly placing orders withour permission.,i browsing tha app trying look meal order suddenly note order way i quickly restaurant cancel order i instructed call i informed i cancellation fee order already you check application suddenly permission

If there's no driver you'll wait until your food gets cold. There's no way to contact uber eats when this happens and they provide no credit. I don't advise using this app. Highly disappointed.,if driver wait food cold there way contact eats provide credit i advise app highly disappointed
