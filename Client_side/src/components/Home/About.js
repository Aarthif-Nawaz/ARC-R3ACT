          You can see all the postive and negative reviews regarding your app
          using ARC. All you have to do to start the process is type the name of
          the mobile application in the search bar at the top of this page. Once
          the app has been selected, click on Search. Give our servers a moment
          to analyse the thousands of reviews submitted to Google Play Store
          regarding that app. Once the analysis is over, you will be lead to a
          menu where you can choose from three options - bug fixes, feature
          requests and overall sentiment.
