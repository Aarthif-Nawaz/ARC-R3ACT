          </h3>
          <p>
            The sentiment score is a score ranging from 0 to 100% that analyses

            6. Why is an app I am searching for not available?
          </h3>
          <p>
            An app may not be eligible for analysis if it has less than 100
            reviews. So if an app is on Google Play Store but not available,
            this may be the reason.
