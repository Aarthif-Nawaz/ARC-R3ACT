This app has big issues and after today I might stop using it all together. The most important thing to fix is for the user to cancel a trip when the driver already marked the user as inside the car. One driver racked up 17000lkr of fees as he didn't mark the trip as finished in his app. Had I been able to mark it as ended it would not have been such an issue. The original trip was for 200lkr,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally we use pick me recently we had bad experience many times drivers ask us to cancel because it was a small destination.you can see how we were treating to the drivers in our points. ..we had lot long journey too with pick me....u can check...so we feel very bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After latest update the app doesn't add food to cart! Update before that made the map on food deliveries quite glitchy. You guys should get a proper app development and testing team first of all!,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Drivers are unprofessional. Some won't accept card payments. Some dont know how to use the GPS map.

When you pay with points it doesn't show the driver that I paid with points sometimes. Its really annoying when that happens and I have to call the customer care to convince them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is getting worse day by day, drivers are accepting the ride and then call and ask to cancel from our side, most of the time no vehicle, poor service, really a time waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's useful app, but they need to work on intercity rides. drivers expect a city ride and when they understand the destination, they cancel it. also prebook feature does not work, mine was silently cancelled, when time came.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually wake up in 5 and leave at 6:30 none of the vehicles are available at that time it is VERY FRUSTRATING when I can not find a driver when I want to.speaking of drivers most of them accept the ride and then remain unresponsive in the map as well as the calls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Superb!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's morning trip was awful. My initial amount shows as LKR 230 when I booked the trip and time estimation shows as 15 min there were no traffic in the road but driver used another route apart from my normsl route which shows in the driver app. At the end of the trip amount shows as LKR 270 and it took more than 15 min to arrive my destination. This app is misleading the customers. Totally dissapointed with the service. Complain added but still no response.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I ordered food at 10.40 .pm after training and I got a call at 12.pm saying my order has to be cancelled I was kept waiting for over an hour to have my dinner and then it was cancelled. I tried to order something else but no other restaurants were open. I lodged a complaint and they said they would get back to me within 2 working days but it's been over a 10 days now and no one has contacted me regarding the matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the riders are going another directions. But in the app my location is correct. Today the rider went to Adhikaram road. But I'm in Uswatta road. He asked me to come to Adhikaram road. Sometimes Pick me directions are wrong. Riders argue with me. Some riders come to correct address without any issue. Please correct the fault of PickMe directions and locations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This App keep sending me notifications telling that i have promo code offers on rides but when i go and check there's none. So disturbing,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking extra amount of money saying for booking charges . Drivers are sometimes unfriendly and unfair when asked about the extra amount they charge. Also it's misleading when Drivers are too busy appears so it takes a lot of time to connect a driver .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In December I got a service from your company from Kadawatha to Colombo. I was charged up to 54km for this. But actually there is only 27 km. I have complained about this to the company but no one has responded to it yet. This is how much money people take. We are ignorant,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Misleading. It says ""All drivers are busy"" when it can't find a taxi. No taxis appear on the map. But it continues to search for drivers in the background. This happens even after you close the app. I get phone calls from drivers saying they are waiting for me half and hour after I initially tried to book a taxi. Not only is it an inconvenience for the user but also the driver who expects a fare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very good! but no riders,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very fast taxi sri lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once the app can't find a driver it gives you a screen that says All drivers are busy. This is misleading, because the app is actually looking for drivers in the background. There have been multiple instances where drivers have called me 20 or 30mins later after arriving at the location, but I had already left and am not in that location. This is quite inconvenient. I don't expect this substandard UX from an app like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Appalled at the professionalism at PickMe. I had a horrible experience in November and to date I have not received a proper response from Pickme on either their app or even their phone or Email channels.

From that point I have almost weekly or bi-weekly called for an update to which I get the run-around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please don't use this app. It's highly unreliable. I ordered food and the driver went to the wrong place and my card got charged the full amount. When I tried to complain they said driver said I'm uncontactable and then cancelled the order so it's my fault. I was never uncontactable. In fact the driver's number in the app was incorrect and I couldn't contact him at all despite many attempts. Uber Eats costs slightly higher but their service is much more reliable. Please use that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full of scammers. I've had 3 out of 3 bad experiences. First the driver arrived and told me he had a technical difficulty (he had clearly logged out of the app and was just tapping on the login screen). He clearly wanted us to cancel and pay cash directly to him. Then we had a journey that seemed fine but I got a call to say I had underpaid. Seemed dodgy. Then a driver called ahead to say he had a new car and so his number plate was different. Also you can't tip. Stick to Uber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pickme app has gone bad to worse and terrible. Same trip with similar distance the app shows different kms and hence higher charge. Drivers after accepeting a trip keep silent and when called upon they say they are in a far away place and cant come asking us to cancel. Very poor customer care with no agent to talk to. This service should be banned in Sri Lanka and give the cheated money back to customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drivers are not taking the short rides,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Driver standards need to be improved. Most of the drivers are not professionals. Sometimes bad discipline and not aware about offers given by PickMe. Some call and ask for the destination and ask to cancel. Some ask weather its a card payment and if a card they ask to cancel. Food delivery part needs to be improved a lot considered to the other competitors. But it is useful most of the time and overall helpful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I've been using pickme since it was launched. And with my overall experience I will never reccomend it to anyone especially women! They (Pickme) dont care about the driver, they just give anyone, the job. There are soo many pickme drivers who Drive recklessly (most of the young drivers) and they charge more money than it shows and when u tell that, they will shout at you. So please fix. The only! only! thing which I like about this app is that it is very user friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The app shows ride availability in 5 min, 7 min, etc. Misleading customers, but no rides available, plus shows that its searching for a ride for so many minutes and after so many minutes it says no rides available 90% of the time or the driver is coming from a distance of 4 to 5 Km away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

when you add a promo code you dont see the discounted price in pickme food make it correct it is the only issue with this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very very poor service. The app is going crazy would be the right way to say it because even when the driver has cancelled the trip, without even me booking another cab I got calls from several other drivers asking if I booked a cab. That is very annoying especially when the drivers are not cooperating. You either fix the app and get the drivers sorted or freaking remove the damn thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wona know- way sometimes price is going up on end of the trip? I was make booking for 480 rupia but end of the trip price grow 580rupia. Why????? More I use more I upsed!!!! Two drivers didn't come on order. Uber is better,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This app used to work okay, but its faulty now. It cannot identify the shortest path and suggest to take longer way even with 0 traffic in both roads. Then charge for the suggested longer path, even if we choose the shorter quick road. Charged me 472 LKR for only 5.5 Km by tuk tuk. It should be around 220 LKR. I requested a refund and received it as Pickme points after few days. The same thing happened again, this time charged 383 LKR for 210 LKR trip. Raised a complaint again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2019/11/03 - I updated. After that many functions are not working well. Errors are occuring often. Showing wrong location. some time, can't place the order(when I checkout, it is showing - ""hotel is in a long distance. choose near hotel."" but, it is wrong information. some time it is showing- ""we are coming soon to your region"". but, I am in usual place where I use pickme regularly. And , add a button to cancel the order if the order was not accepted by any driver for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No response from the company after several complaints (twice over the phone, via app and e-mail) Wasting cx time and risking privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grateful service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the start PickMe was great but now the drivers seem to ignore you on your pickup location and go ahead to your destination and charge you for a trip you didn't take. I've had this experience on 2 occasions and I didn't receive a response for my complaints from PickMe at all. Obviously the way you treat your customers is absolutely poor and this is why I'm giving a 1 star rating and really wish I could give no rating at all because your service and response is hopeless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been using pickme since the day one but sometimes they charge you for wrong distances and customer service officers does absolutely nothing about your complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also attempted to do a pre booking and I got a confirmation of the booking. 30 minutes before the expected pick up time (the next day), we got a call to say no cars were available. They said that the request was confirmed, but not the car and there wasnt one. Which is ridiculous and not helpful. Either its confirmed or it's not!! Then we were left stranded and no taxi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I use PickMe app ofently both in Colombo & Gampaha which is my hometown. But I must say the location update of the app is very slow and it sometimes shiw wrong time estimations which caused lot of trouble for the driver as well as me. Sometimes the app shows the driver is going passing the pickup location, so I call him and say the way he is going is wrong. But infact he has comes the right way and the app has shown some wrong infor which is very inconveninet and lead to waste of time",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This app is not wrking properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My address is not been captured properly on the pick me app. The driver always goes & parks the vehicle at a location behind my house where I do not have any access as there's a parapet wall. It causrs much inconvenient to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfare charges. Normal taxi cost Rs.70 but pickme cost Rs.135,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst app. And very poor service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thinking both Driver and passenger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very effective,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is badly designed. PickMe charges by distance, but the app doesn't show the running total. Hence there are unexpected extra charges when traffic is dense. The app's ""Set Location on Map"" is a disaster, it deletes the location that's already entered. Their competition's app in contrast is simple to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Functions well as a ride sharing app but PickMe food is attrocious.

"I use both pick me and uber very often.  When compared with Uber, pick me trip fares are much higher.

"Literally the worst hailing app out there now this service used be my favourite, but now they've up the pricing for all hailing and the price estimates aren't accurate at all. The prices once the ride is over will always be higher than the estimate, additionally the UI isn't intuitive by any means just looks clustered and not precious",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Services are very bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Must improve showing the driver's location. Caused conflict and confusion between my last ride due to issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is not reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New version of this app creates too much annoying advertiesments. Abnormal data usage for advertiesments. Have no option to turn off unnecessory notifications. As a percentage this app got 50-50 pros and cons. Definitly will move to another app if i have an option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hey Pickme, As a result, I love the idea of pickme. Its more convenient and better than getting a tuk/vehicle from outside. The more days pass by the more better it gets. But however, it glitches a lot where it gets on my nerves. Am i the only one who cannot find a tuk after 6pm(it always claims that there are no drivers)! Moreover, doesnt the tuk drivers know about the PROMOtions? They be like why one earth has the price decreased and then ask a higher amount which will lead to an argument! TY",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pickme implemented a feature for drivers which will enable them to take hires even when they are currently on a hire if there are no other vehicles available.

"I uninstalled this app for 2 reasons: 1. When you order food or want a taxi, the app uses a ton of data for some odd reason, which is quite abnormal. I ve used uber as well which consumes like 1/5th of pickme. Most of my friends have also complained on this. I don't understand why so much data is required for a static map and bit of GPS. 2. On pickme food, when you place an order and the restaurant accepts the order it takes ages to assign a rider (maybe the rider population has shrunk).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

And also the price rates should be watched some are pretty unreliable. though am a loyal customer I get only a few offers. and also you all might have to add more bikes not only in Colombo area buy also in places dehiwala,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pickme is really good but I would like an update where you get an otp from the customer and then the meter starts because every time I use this mode of transportation I have to pay a large amount and the drivers say it is the waiting charge. how can they start their even before we've got into the vehicle and started our journey? I would really appreciate if you could bring in this update soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getting better but if they can allow us to access to the trips we completed that would be easy for us to give stars to the drivers. Because most of the time we book in a hurry so we don't give stars.

very disrespectful drivers. They don't even call when they reach the destination to inform the passenger. They are not willing to take the route we want them to take.

"I am a regular user of pick me three wheelers. I am sorry to blame you.Earlier all the pick me Three wheelers were best in condition. Also the drivers were wearing nicely . But now I have found so many three wheelers which are dirty, with corrosion , seats cover with material carpets from pamunuva (we have to sit on these mats). drivers wearing dirty cloths and fast driving.I think as earlier you should check their vehicles regularly.

PickMe food customer service sucks! They don't update their restaurants food menus they're linked to. We order a food item and that is not available in that place. When our money is being taken for no apparent reason they don't even refund. Sometimes we order one thing and the delivery guy delivers something else. PickMe even try to blame it on us as if it was our fault whilst it is certainly clear it's their own fault. I have almost Rs.610 to get refunded but they never gave me back my money!,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I dont know why there are bad reviews for this because i had a bad driver only once. For me the best part of this is sometimes when we are stuck at the road and cant easily find a meter taxi the taxi driver comes to the exact location nicely. And when we go somewhere we are actually not sure how yo go, jjst give the destination and theyll take you there with the lowest fare. And apart from once , I have had very friendly drivers. The app is very easy to use and it gives clear steps on how to book",,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have a fixed fare like Uber because some drivers take extremely long routes and charge about 150 extra rupees than the estimated price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They ignore short trips and trips in rainy days. Sometimes accept the trip and never pickup or never let us know about it (waste of time). Every time ask ""where to go"" or ""may i turn on the meter"" from where he is. Sometimes turn off the device once after they accept the trip.

I pre-booked a mini at 2.20pm but it had arrived by 2.05pm... The driver kept calling and asking me if I was coming but I had to explain that I had booked the vehicle at 2.20 pm..

"I was waiting for a Tuk i have booked when I got the email saying that the trip has been completed and a trip fee is deducted. A glitch, maybe. There is no hotline to report these. The ""hotline"" mentioned is not a real hotline, but a recording asking to report any complaints through the app. I'm still trying to find the complaints section in the app so they can reach me within 2 business days. Since this is charging for a service not consumed, will be informing Consumer Affairs Authority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bad service. Opened a ticket. No response and don't give driver details. Pick me cheats. Drivers try to cheat most of the time as they take longer routes. Uber is 10000% better than pickme,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Im Not Good With Pickme Because Its Not Fixed Price When We Travel They Gives Us Promo Code When We active Its not The Charge They Says Us Its Double Rate Better Going On Normal Meter Taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate you!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have been using this app for a long time now but as of late it lags and you can never find a driver around rush hour. It says a driver is 4 minutes away but if you try to book then there are no drivers?!?! Frustrating,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very comfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
puntual,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good drivers I have used every vehicle category except vip vehicles pls make vip vehicles readily available in negombo pls kind regards and pls let us select the required vehicle because I'm a traveler so I prefer a fit shuttle or pruis but lastest update I got a insight which I hate a lot pls just make that option available then I can chose a pruis or fit shuttle as my preference and app is really useful everyone in our family is using this app but kind regards pls make my request a reality,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I start trip from Bambalapitiya, as i got in i smelled that he was drunk. Over the drive he was asking so many questions continously which are not relevant to do his job at all, especially he was requesting mobile number telling that he can pick me even in the morning. Due to this uncomfortable situation at night, i decided to cancel trip an ask him to stop the vehicle but he kept on driving telling its not possible to cancel trip after came to Dehiwala. Even if i asked Pickme HO number to cancel",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Average. No more attractive promos. And I gave 3 stars because, sometimes in the airport area, it shows that there's a ride in arrival area but, when I book the ride it shows that ride is coming from 10mins far. This I believe to be a hack from some riders. Look in to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pick me foods is so inconvenient to use. it doesn't show the address of the restaurant, customizing options, or any information about the restaurant even after the order has been placed. also you can't search by food type and choose from the restaurants that serve that particular type of food so it has to be a specific restaurant name and that's really irritating. needs a lot more improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

been a loyal user of pick me for a looong time. haven't had too many issues wrt to drivers & fares. Only thing I'd add is that your customer service needs to be better.

This application is full of bugs. Most of the time drivers accept the booking and cancel. Not a reliable cab service. Most of the budget cars are not maintained properly. I cant recommend this app and cab service. New version is worse than the previous app. Most of the cab drivers are unhappy of the app and the company. Pls don't download this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so unsatisfied... drivers aren't coming although they are available. and drivers take too much time to arrive to the location. not even worth of giving a one star,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some drivers are useless. some of them can't follow the map. some drivers cancel the trip after few min. wasting our time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely a great taxi service for Sri Lanka. App is very well done and user friendly. Also, the PickMe food delivery service is a remarkable add-on and so convenient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

this app does not allow the traveller to check if they are going on the right route.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have mentioned 35/= per km but they are charging more than that even the offer doesn't work at all .. don't fool people by giving fake promises,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theres a issue in pricing showed me in range of 300 and 320 but came a final of 370.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PICK ME NEEDS TO DEAL ISSUE WITH DRIVER BEHAVIOUR AND TO TEAIN DRIVERS THROUGH APP TO BECOME EXPERIENCE NAVIGATORS (IN ALL CATEGORIES). IN THIS CASE IT NEEDS TO CONDUCT A STONG RESEARCH UNIT TO UNDERSTAND WEAKNESES IN THE SYSTEM AND TO FOCUS ON DRIVER AND CONSUMER INTERACTION. HOWERVER BRINGS A GOOD STEP UP FOR SRI LANKA DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. INTERFACE AND TECH IS 40/100. HOPE TO SEE PICK ME IMPROVE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i used the app while on holiday in sri lanka. although it provides a good service i do not understand why it always took so long for the drivers to come pick me up (edit: ive foundbout drivers experience gps issues sometimes and want location confirmation from customer). i always had to call them. why does the app not provide standardized messages to tell the drivers to come pick customer up on the gps/asked location? please make this an option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We ordered a pick up from Colombo city centre today unfortunately the driver picked up a wrong party. As the drivers phone was switched off there was no way of communicating. We couldn't make use of the app or cancel our trip as long as the taxi is hired. We could see the vehicle on the other side of the road picking up the wrong people. The pick me staff at Colombo city centre was not able to help us in getting another taxi. They were just a bunch of jokers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"today i used this service 1st time,due to unaviidable prob arised with my pvt transportation. but the experience was unpleaseant. as i hv heard, pick me send the nearest driver..bt today, the driver has come along a long distance than i had to go. then the ride was full of driver's critisism. blah blah. i said sorry, as i didnt know abt the cancellation...i will not use this again..u better send the nearest driver, if not plz consider the distances..thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Good service. However, PickMe Foods needs some more refinements; 1) Need to be able to rate the restaurants which we order food from 2) A map view of the nearby restaurants in addition to the list would be helpful 3) When browsing the list, when I select a restaurant and then go back, I am taken back to the begining of the list. I should be taken to the last position I was in the list so that I dont need to scroll all the way back 4) There should be PickMe Foods specific complaint options",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very useful! Hope you will add more places in the future! Good luck guys! Hats off to the app developers! I got the full experiences. Fast delivery! Excellent! Love it.

The majority of drivers have no idea about the roads nor don't know how to use Google maps. Also not a single driver picks when it's around evening time and they always call you and ask where to go and cancel the booking..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:( This app would be great except... There is a persistent problem with overcharging by tuk tuk drivers delaying completion of rides. I feel like this has happened often enough to be deliberate overcharging. I reported this to pickme customer service but instead of a refund i was questioned at length about my rides and then told i need to instruct drivers to end fares when i leave their vehicle. If that's really the case there should be instructions to that effect in the app UI. I'm afraid I'll be using Uber in the future whenever possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its all good. but the promo code need to bs activated every time. if it could be active for the period it would be great. else we miss the offers,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"*overall it's an awful service* your so called ""pickme"" service has caused a lot of inconveniences to me. The recent irritating incident was that none of the available drivers accepted my trip since it's a rainy day or some other reason but however it just caused me a lot of problems that day,because I was trying my very best to get a vehicle to attend an important function but none of the available drivers accepted my request so I'm utterly disappointed about your overall service and performance. Please do note that before you offer us a rain of promotions make sure that you offer the proper service,also teach your employees a sense of discipline regards to this matter. Also this wasn't the first time. Once when I requested for a pick me ,this certain driver accepted but didn't come for the pick up and I had to stay for 15 minutes or more for him until I contacted him and got to know that he's not coming.During that time he didn't even inform me or cancel my request. If these above simillar incidents happened to a customer who's facing an emergency would your company take the responsibility of the consequential impact of those incidents? It might sound as a minor problem to you but this can bring a lot of problems which you won't even imagine of happening. So do your business right,treat your customers well, provide them with good satisfaction,for that train and motivate your staff well. *Currently I'm disappointed about your service*",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cheating company with low quality drivers. I blacklisted this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pick me used to be a good service but nowadays there are no vehicles when its rain and map doesn't even work accurately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app ever.. we got so many promotion codes but none of those works.. at the beginning trip charge shows as a less amount.but when we come to end it shows a higher amount.. so how can wen pay for that.. this app is a lie. Really disappointed about pick me..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
üëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy the offers. Taxi reaching the passenger concept suits the country so well. Focussing more on drvers' disciplne (tuk drivers) would bring the demand to even higher levels coz no one likes feeling unsafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drivers are cheating. Even when I use the promo codes they are not accepting it and they are asking for the full amount. I may have to switch from PickMe to any other transportation and travel assistance. If this is not considered and show the full amount after the ride is ended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ishi Bhoi is absolutely correct.  You cannot pick your location.   Previously it was fine, but now my road is not displayed but a parallel road is  displayed as my location.  But that road is a ""one way"" road. So if the driver goes down that road, he would need an additional half hour to get back.   I informed my issue by email and Messenger .  1st email sent on 26th Sept and received Standard acknowledgement. Followed up with a messages on messenger 6th October, 9th Oct and 10th Oct.  The last message received acknowledged that it was a ""bug"" and that it would take 4 weeks to resolve. 4 weeks have come and gone, but no resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
This taxi service is not good. Drivers like thieves. They ask more money than app shows. Not behaving professional. Undesent drivers and old vehicles. Not in good condition,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When ever you want cabs, there just aren't ANY!!! Specially in the morning! I have been trying for about an hour but NO cabs in any of the categories.

Keeps getting stuck and can't identify my current location (even when GPS is ON). If you think it's an issue with my phone GPS well NO it's not cos other service providers received exact locations at all times. I would Love to use Pick Me as my preferred ride provider since its a local product and I believe that we must support our local industries to grow within #keepitlocal therefor please update your app and make it right so that we can support you!.

"Worst complaining system ever. If you file a complaint you literally have to go and poke at your ticket every 10 minutes, to check whether they replied. No email confirmation, no notification for complaints. If you missed their response, they'll close the ticket mentioning you never responded. Really disappointed with the user experience. Don't expect them to response in 48 hours either. With my experience, just don't lose anything in a taxi. It's better than whatever this is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it's really unfair, that if we place a hire and if we cancels it after 5 minutes we will be charged, as it wastes the time and fuel of the driver... But some drivers accept a hire and cancels it after more than 10 minutes, wasting our time finally... Time is a very important factor, and we seriously worry about it... This delays us, and effect our punctuality... So I hope to get a solution for this...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something has happened in the last few days with the app. It cannot even be downloaded with ease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tired of waiting on drivers.. Either they accept and delay or your navigation takes them on a unnecessarily longer route.. Will be switching to another app,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously one of the driver asked me to cancel the trip, but before I do that he started the trip, so I had to wait 45mins until he realized his mistake, so please please add a failsafe option for that",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The app itself is good but the customer support is not. A driver insisted I paid cash despite the fact I'd already paid by card - I contacted the customer support via the app who closed the ticket without a response and I now have no way to contact them for a refund. If using this app play it safe and always select pay with cash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A app which is not taking much money approximately this app is a very useful app and also good app for people for traveling,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useless for tourists with non local numbers. Found me rides in Colombo's central city areas only, elsewhere and in Mirissa and Kandy it was of no use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not showing the directions on a ride is the weakness in this...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I dont recommend pickme at all when there is offers it doesn't work at all. Unless it works. Betraying the clients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can't get a taxi during the traffic time . DRIVERS never accept request 6:00am to 9:00am , 5:00pm to 7:00pm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service & most useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"They have started adding hidden charges e.g 'peak time charges' without notifying users. Be aware and careful. Even you don't notice this as you do the booking, but you will get to know at the end of the journey",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not so bad . Low price .üëçüëçüëçüëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pre-booking system is so messed up.we booked a van like a day prior to our journey and no vehicle arrived to pick us up. We ended up getting late to a very important family occasionn. Customer support is just terrible. Three-wheeled drivers are just not that friendly As a transport app it is good but it is not one you will be enjoying at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best customer service thankzzz,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why the app needs permisson to access contacts of the mobile and device information and wifi connection??? Its unwanted.... This app is not safe.... Be aware.... These people can get all ur informations and contacts....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My account has been blocked. Support number does not give customer assistance,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job..üëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a good experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Must use this much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is useful but most of the drivers doesn't know how to come to the 
pickup location they call us and ask the way to come to the pickup location",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Totally pointless app for planning longer distance trips... Booked a pick up for me and the family days in advance, only to have it canceled a few hours before we were supposed to leave due to no drivers... Won't use again as it can't be trusted...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waste of time. Drivers accept pickups from far and then cancel. Takes about 
4 to 5 tries and also prepare to keep doing for 2 hours or so. If you need 
I have proof to support sms cancelling from you. Annoying when you are in a 
hurry. Good concept that's all. But needs more drivers and ability to pick 
drivers instead of them accepting from far away and making us wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waiting charges are high. Prices are higher than the other competitors. If 
you want to win customers give them offers. Some drivers also not happy abt 
your company. Now your main competitor is Uber. They are offering low rates 
than you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't add frimi wallet to the payment method,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Love it and thank you for your great promotion offers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have only a very limited knowledge re this application,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pickme was good when it's first. Now it's getting sucks. The term sucks 
including (app issues, doesn't show up prices instantaneously even after we 
enter the drop off address, no discount on Keells pick ups and drop offs, 
drivers cheating on waiting before even we get in to the three wheel, very 
poor customer service, thus they have automated system. Cant even redeem 
our vouchers, bad points redeem system Etc;) Thanks for the good old days. 
Looking forward to seeing another app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Always vehicle not available, wrong estimate prices.. actual prices nearly 
2x",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App works well, but why cannot we simultaneously make 2 or more bookings at 
once? Have to wait until the ride comes to an end to make another. This is 
a drawback since passengers who have many ppl with them requiring more 
taxis with only a single device in hand are stranded due to this. Hope this 
feature could be added as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent App,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I just recently updated my pickme app. When i opened it , it says that the 
location update has failed. Im a daily user of pickme. Please try to fix

No more transporation matters,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I used Pick Me Up when I was visiting Sri Lanka. It was okay until a driver 
never showed up but I was charged for some random trip. I filed a complain 
with Pick Me Up. They were supposed to resolve it. They did nothing about 
it until I left. As a tourist, it is better to use Uber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is good but app is stucking,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service,,,,,,,,,,,,,

either please fix it asap",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good work,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Useless. They provide invalid promocodes. Rates are much higher than 
others. If order drivers might refuse to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

travel(while booking) and than, the amount what we gets after reach the 
destinations, its totally different. For an example before travel its shows 
330 rupees, after reach the destination 380 rupees. Yes i understand it

"I normally use this app frequently but then always downtime blocks and etc 
are happening which is so ANNOYING! Like the other day, i wanted to get 
home asasp around 8 and this app didnt start!!!!! Like seriously? No one 
can depend on pickme Sri Lanka and specially in my hometown, people are so 
rude and they doesnt even care to call and tell me to cancel but goes the 
other direction or passing me. You all need to have some disciplines or 
sack those type of fellows. We all depend for a transportation because 
these days its not safe to walk!!! If your all doesnt look into some these 
issues, slowly you all will loose one by one and there will be bad views of 
this app. Please look into this matter specially and make the app steady

Nice app very useful. Good user interface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location and navigation issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The last update is listed here only as April 02, 2018. I was informed by 
Pickme official that app was updated fixing bugs just two days ago which 
should be May 30th or 31st. However this present app is having many bugs 
including inability to rate the drivers at the end of a ride randomly, 
random erroneous Pop up window displaying no internet connection asking to 
go to settings but actually my mobile internet is working. Sometimes 
freezing that Pop up window compelling me to restart the phone and get back 
to app which is very uncomfortable and time wasting when I'm finishing a 
ride and in a hurry to get off. During rainy times it doesn't display any 
type of vehicles showing as no vehicles. Sometimes forcing me to log in 
using username and password when I have not actually logged out. These 
errors were not so much few months before but now it's getting worse. Also 
have an option to lodge a complimentary note about a good driver after the 
ride just like you have the option to lodge a complaint for individual 
drivers used on hires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can t creat a password, whatever i try its always the same message: issue 
with authentication",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good at giving promos and all. some drivers are rude , some are great.but 
they UNFAIRLY charge for waiting even though the customer is the one who 
waits about 5-10minutes. Also I wanna know on what basis do they give promos",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30/05/18 Recently I'd booked a three wheel and all of a sudden the app 
crashed in the drivers app..Then we had to pay the driver higher price than 
average.. This had happened another times too.. unsatisfied with quality of 
service .. even now the trip hasn't ended in my phone..",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A very useful app for me. Low prices and loyal drivers. Special offers. 
Love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well job,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Location fetching function does not function properly for the user as well 
as the driver it seems. The drivers go all over the place because they get 
the location wrong. This has happened to me more than once and when they 
finally arrive at the location the drivers start blasting Us as if it's the 
user's fault! More than once, I had to walk in order to meet the driver as 
the driver was unable to get the directions right! Last time had to wait 
for more than 20 minutes for the driver to find the location and that wad 
only after I walked part of the way!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

need to go. Some drivers doesn't like to come after get to know about drop 
location. But with greatest difficulty from recent used location sometimes 
i managed to select drop location. But i cannot use it for all the drop 
locations which i need to go. Same thing happenes if i need to select 
different pick location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great App. But sometimes it shows wrong locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When it's a pick up & a drop @ the same location, the customers have no way 
to log in that information in & it has led to many unpleasant experiences 
with chauffeurs. Because of this we would have to input an interim location 
as the final destination and when we do that, chauffeurs thinking that the 
hire is not worth the distance, reject the order. Suggestion: could you 
include ""Return to pick up location"" button in the app, in addition to the 
""Destination"" field. Then the customer will be able to mention the furthest 
location he will go + that he intends to return back. Now a hire which 
looked as if only 4kms will become a hire of 8kms and this will keep the 
chauffeurs interested and also will give them sufficient information 
whether to pick the order or not. Good service so far. Keep it up",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a help full app But need get more advance I like this app!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and they will get back to you within 2 days. Can you believe that. It's 
hilarious. Once I met a nuisance driver who kept me calling and troubling

This appp is a life saving app &lt;3,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know how to get my pic on there but it a good app I really like like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App has both functional and non functional issues. Most of the time pickme is not capable of loading the map pointed to current location(cant be an issue with phone since i have three other map based apps and they all work). This is the taxi app with highest data consumption (much higher than uber or kangroo). I noticed it accidentally and tested it few times and results were same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's the price for 1 km?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best app for get a cab.anywhere anytime.better then uber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dehiwala,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app is OK .the actual taxis not so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No benefit for customers if the driver arrives late. They charge you for canceling so you have to wait until driver arrives even if takes 1 hour. They charge us for waiting on the ride but no waiting benefit when we wait for vehicle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Im a tourist, i use uber in the UK. This app is somewhat similar to uber although the sri lanka local equivalent. The app itself is great and works as you would expect.   The issues i encountered are due to drivers, many call you to ask the pickup and drop of location. This is typically with older drivers, the younger ones who know how to use there smartphones had no such issue. Often when a driver does ring, you end up cancelling the trip as you are unable to communicate sufficiently well with them to explain your pick up and drop off location.  The only bad experience was a driver who asked for 1000 rupees to drive back to Mirissa after dropping us off at Yala. After a long trip i wasn't up for arguing so paid him 500 rupees.  Overall i would recommend the app to tourists, as long as you are not expecting as seamless a service as uber is in the western world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
The services aren't very good. The drivers accept the trip and then call us and tell us to cancel the trips. It happened to me so many times now. The drivers use fowl language even with women. This needs to be fixed. I Will recommend uber than pick me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So much better than uber.   Cheaper prices (because pick me charges drivers 10% while uber 25%)  Great service (more vehicles compared to uber).   More vehicle types (tuktuk, nano, mini car, car, van, vip etc) which matches the price I pay.   Friendly drivers. I have gone on about 30 trips and have found all the drivers to be nice folks.   Also there is a waiting fee feature (Rs. 240/hr I think) so drivers don't complain for waiting. Plus it allows us to hire one vehicle for many trips with short stops.   The app is very reliable. Never crashed. It has all the required functionality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It charges Rs.350 per waiting hour but the app says Rs. 210 per hour. Also the rate per km is more than Rs. 33 as stated by the app. Other than that it is a very convenient app for transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cunning drivers, trying take longer routes to charge more. disgusting",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank You PickMe! My PickMe ride was totally free today. Much appreciated  and a very Happy customer ‚ô°,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app and easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verry useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It says to turn On the location service but its already On..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb but need more free rides,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At around 4pm there are no vehicles of any type at hulftsdorp area. The pick me management must monitor theor drivers as well. Once a driver asked for more money than what appeared on the pickme reader telling there is something wrong in the machine. I even placed a complain at that point. But it appears to be more and more corrupted drivers. Should check all these. Cz the app is becoming very unpopular.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its ok  but...,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The worst cab hailing app in Sri Lanka and possibly in this South Asian region. Horrible, unprofessional, unethical, nosy, indisciplined drivers who have no idea where they are going, cancel the ride after accepting and  keeping you waiting for hours on end.

"Horrible app. After I chnged to a new phone, i cant use my account any more. The verification process says its sending an sms to my phone which I never recieve. And in their infinite wisdom the creators have not added another verification method. Just wow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very convenient,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The estimates are no way close to the amount they charge. It's always the same estimate even during traffic times. It always says 100-104 to this one trip I take regularly but always charge around 150. And once on another trip it said 50-55 eventhough the starting price is 60 hahahaha.  The drivers accept our trips and then scold us saying it's a short distance. We already told them our drop off location so couldn't they have seen that earlier when accepting trip.   Also,the whole point of having maps is so that they'd know the way and won't ask us. But hey,they ask us, we don't know and they go around in circles and charge us more  Get Pick Me!üíØ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Why you charge LKR 60 as a call up charge? In normal Tuks, it's LKR 50 for the first Kilometer and then chargeable more after the first kilometer. But in pickme you charge LKR 60 and charges  LKR 93 if we only travel 1 km.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its very good and if you  are trying to valid as in kurunegala thats too better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't see app sharing button. Pl arrange it. App is ok. But sometimes location  is not correct therefore drivers are going  to wrong places. Waste time of drivers and customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible. I needed a ride from a remote area to the airport at 2am, so I used PickMe's ""Book Later"" feature to schedule a pickup (10 hours in advance). I promptly received an SMS confirming my booking, and the details were also listed in the app under ""My Trips.""  2am came around and there was no car in sight. My booking magically disappeared from the app, with no cancellation notice, in spite of the confirmation they sent me earlier.  No one answered their customer support phone number or email address at the time and still now, a full day later.  I could've missed my flight but luckily I found a local taxi company that was still open and agreed to take me.  What a disastrously poor service. If you need a reliable transportation service that will be there when they say they will, I suggest you look elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes it shows correct location to the user but not to the driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been my all time favourite! So far not been disappointed and hoping the same in future!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Worst service provided 2. No avalability of vehicles, even if available certain drivers dont accept our request 3.certain drivers accept and tel to cancel 4.

Best taxi service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is absolutely useful.. surly my first choice to book a taxi. Love this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Convenient service but their customer support is terrible.  They use to have an option to file a complaint on their phone line but now it asks you to email them, knowing moat people won't do that. Even then they don't do much to help the customer. On top of that they will allow anyone to register with them. So instead of checking if the people who register with them have serious criminal records they simply added a SOS button to the app lol If you accidentally leave something it will be robbed. This happened several times to me, the drivers have no incentive to bring anything back. And the company will not fire them because they are more interested in making money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This  apps very good    This app is very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the first time I've visited Sri Lanka and used this app. However I found it very useful and cheap to get around. Having the estimated cost before hand is very helpful as you're less likely to be ripped off. I also like that you can pay in cash or by credit/debit card. I personally prefer cash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is a great app. i have been having it in my phone's and tablets for the past one year or so but never have used it as much as i used it for the past couple of days.i couldn't park my vehicle at my home cuz of the constructions going on and had to park it every night in my apartment which is rented and had to come home and go pick it up next morning, for around 4 days ... this app helped me a lot i took taxi's from borella to ratmalana in evenings around 9 to 10 and in the morning from ratmalana to borella around 6 to 9 this app saved me the stress of walking towards galle road to get a taxi and the stress of figuring out charges per trip ... the drivers were quick and responsive, one time we actually got stuck in traffic at borella and i thought it will charge a lot more which it didnt at the end, for all the people who got issues they may charge u higher prices but they clearly state the price will differ from the shown due to traffic and other reasons which is acceptable. everyone this is just the app and the taxi's actually run on fuel think about it. and i guess the company should figure out something about the drivers who turn off there systems on heavy traffic times - maybe because they ain't getting the payment they deserve for the fuel that gets wasted on traffic times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fantastic app. But is there a way youll could incorporate a voice guide for directions(something like what google maps has) for the driver to locate the house of the person who made the booking? Lots of times I personally have found the driver having either gone too far from my location or having missed the turn and unable to come back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update is very bad. We can't click the drop location button quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Best app ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing much,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rubbish.. don't have any location to pick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. There is an advanced booking which does not make any sense. You will get a cab only if there is one around that time. If there's nothing left around you will be left stranded.   2. Alot of tuks and nanos accepting the trip and asking to cancel even though my trips are touching 300 rs. Most of them just waste our time by accepting and asking to cancel the trio after few minutes. I emailed customer care but no response on this regard.  3. You have received 2 stars to improve above which you're already providing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fares are low and the range of choices available is good. But every time you make a booking you end up being called by a driver with broken English and desperately trying to explain where they need to pick you up from. Then when they pick you up you have to explain where to drop you off again. What's the point of specifying pickup and dropoff locations if the drivers can't read maps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very poor performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used to be good. Not so much now. Drivers aren't around all the time ‚òπÔ∏è So much disappointment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good service and good advantage app. After you end your trip you will have mail from this app that mentioned your trip waiting charges and total charges .everything so perfect and easy to use .normally other tuk tuk charging more for one km but this service is charging so cheap . I recommend to all use pick me service to save your money. Anyway every company has some disadvantag but we must be patience instead of finding mistakes in all ways.comparing to other tuk drievers and other services for me pick me company is so good so far.I wish you guys good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I only use pick me to support a local alternative to uber. Sadly standards are poor compared to Uber. The drivers always call to ask the pick up location even though it's clearly in the app. The app itself is very slow and takes ages to process requests. PLEASE TRAIN YOUR DRIVERS to use the app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This pick me service is really good I really like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good and ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the last update the app has been taking ages to open up. The loading is very slow.  I have to wait for a minimum of 3 minutes to open the app and another 2 mins to get the location and the most dissapointing thing is after all these efforts you don't find a single vehicle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User friendly  !,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the service is good, must point out that the 'Waiting Charges' you put upon the clients are uncalled for.

Awesome but sometimes very useless,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drivers who use this app always talks and annoys at the same time they charge more than Uber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Driver came & i asked to wait... then he left without informing us... later this message came "" Dear Passenger, We regret to inform you that your booking ref no: 39201384 has been cancelled on driver request. Please request again to book another PickMe""üòÅ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
No 1 taxi service in Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app but very few cabs in colombo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GOOD,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your service is just disgusting. No one picks the rides in peak times or at night even after 7pm. What the hell. Uninstalling this. No point of having an app without any use. Please add staff who can be committed to their job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am regular user of PickMe Tuk Tuk and their mini cars . Its a safe and reliable service provided by a Sri Lankan company .   But lately i find it very hard  to obtain their TUK TUKs in the morning . I have to wait several hours till one is available .  On weekdays  its the same in the evenings ,its  very difficult to get one .  I was made to understand that the drivers switch off their phones which has the app  during heavy traffic time  in the evenings . And most of them  dont  want to take hires in the evening  when  offices close .  Appreciate  the management of PickMe looking into this matter as  its a service to the customer  which they must emphasise  first .  Another issue  i am having is that i cannot  put my starting home address , its always another house number which appears in your App. Eventually your  Drivers  end up at the wrong  address always . I have to call your driver and get them to come to the correct address .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tried last few times. Drivers constantly declining the trips and make me really annoyed. Pick me sure to have some track of cancellations,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good one...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So far it's good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So Easy , Quick & Safe .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intrface is not clear in tabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Useless for booking a mini car,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good for the time been,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app is great but the business doesn't know how to run it !  The tuk guys are just ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the most efficient and fastest way of travelling in Colombo and do not review this app as bad.It is really fast and you can pay cash .There is no need of entering card numbers and I recommend this app as a great acheivment in Sri Lanka.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's no way to edit a rating once we mistakenly rated someone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
üíùüíùüíù,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The final rate does not tally with what's shown upfront when booking. It's way off. I used it for 2 bookings and the final bill was 150% the 1st time and 175% the 2nd time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The location dialog box will not go off even after I turn the location on,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today totally not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the easiest way to book a tuk or a cab in urban areas, easy  to use UI and they have a good number of vehicles too",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gooood,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today i Orderd Pic me Driver pic phone And Ask About Location When i tell him About My Location He Say its Too Near So Cancelled the Trip Plz Fix it And Help Peoples dont too much Greedy....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing with regard to the app, however there are no Tuks during the peak times",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drivers are very inhuman.Always restarts the three-wheeler so that the meter rises and Im even uninstalling this app cause this is the worst!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good app. Fast and easy to find taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome App.its very useful and customer satisfaction.üëçüëçüëçüëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful help for our day to day travel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new update kind of sucks..... I can't see any words of any button... I can't see the fare details or anything... I even tried reinstalling..but it doesn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like me it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's really slow for my mobile,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This crappy update takes 10 mins to locate us and another 20 mins to find a tuk..  Update ASAP!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Idk,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best of the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was better before the last 2 updates. And now the latest update says critical bug fixes. But it seems you guys introduced major bugs to the app. It takea ages to calculate even the arrival time. So disappointed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why now this so slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Legit,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crashes when opening,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have just got an app crash. In 3 days they give me a solution. Now it's working. Very helpful staff. Thanks to Rishoban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the latest update, this app takes for ever to find a cab near me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy to used good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pls ca u over look in to he mtter of this application is clashing... we can't even open the app for last 2 weeks... Appreciate,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just love travelling in pick me. It's very useful  for ur urgent purposes...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After installing the app it can't open. Help me to install the app and work properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This last update is waste of my time and my travel, it not working",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I only managed to use it on one trip. The next time I tried to get it the app had crashed and I was informed that the app had stopped working. Have I got to uninstall and reinstall to get it working?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its good for sri lanken work peoples.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most important,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best alternative to uber in lk,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brilliant app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pickme App wont start. Crashes when opened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good work pick me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you.. very much..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soo many lags,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good app and service. During my vacation I use pick me and it gives good service ones I lost my I pad in the taxi and I call the pick me customer service to help an initially driver didn't answer the call after pick me customer care comes in I got the lost item ...Thanks  they did the job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some cars are not good, some drivers don't know about promo codes and etc. please teach them",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worst app. Very slow. Uber is far better than this. If the driver cancels, it wouldn't automatically assign a new vehicle. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. They need more experience in developing UX/UI.   P.S.:- Never use this app for an emergency case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gud,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app is going crazy... Keep this going and lets see how many use the app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taking years to open up the app. Absolutely testing my patience in need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I waited for hours for someone to pick me up but all the drivers are transfering the pickup to one another no one is confirming plus whats the point of having a navigation when they cant even find the customer via the app. Totally dissapointed. Im removing the app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The app UI is not user friendly, lags a lot and very slow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app loading time and overall response time has increased. I have to wait many seconds to loading screens to disappear even when I am on a good 4G connection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why am I unable to my Visa Devbit card? Have been trying for the last week and I still cannot..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simple and easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow verry good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cant find  any tuk tuk in Kandy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very usful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a bad app. But try arrive alot faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful but difficult to find vehicles in the morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drivers are very rude specially the trishaw one's  They refuse to come if the trip is short and are very rude when speaking to them to give directions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The price ranges are ok with PickMe but some of the drivers in the tuks doesn't even know how to talk to the customers. If its possible please try to add a new feature where I can book a vehicle for another person who is staying in a different location by adding that person's phone number before the booking confirmation so that the driver can communicate with that specific person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very easy work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
üëçüëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great UI and smooth UX most of the time. Revolutionised the way Sri Lanka books taxis and consistent with innovation and updates. Well done!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever. Drivers refuses to come all the time and this service does not care about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After this one trip i couldn't order a ride,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The app hasnt been updated to work properly with 7.1.1 nougat, the app cant seem to connect to gps and cant be exited",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It's working but taxies less available out of Colombo for now. Little bit slow on my Micromax A74 (Android 4.2.2, Dual Core 1.3 MTK, 512MB RAM). Taxi drivers are trained pretty well and they work hard to give you a good service because you can rate them. But for now Pick me is the best taxi app option available. Works faster than Uber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy to travel this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kandy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need to check,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loved it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A much needed app for me. Anytime, there is a taxi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good app good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best taxi booking App in srilanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the new update I'm unable to add the drop location and get an estimate for the amount. It does not allow me to click on a location. Please get this fixed ASAP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drivers don't know how to use Google Maps, always asking us where are we going and where we are, we even need to show them how to use the Map. Drivers changed their cars and did not update, needing us to double confirm the driver's details before boarding. Drivers refused our calls to pick us due to reasons like ""The driver are too far (when they are just less than 2km away from us) or they don't know where are we going and just plain refused to come"" Drivers can't really understand English much, communicating is super difficult, specially when you want them to go to your destination. All in all, the service provided by the drivers is very terrible. Don't even know how Pickme selects its drivers. VERY VERY BAD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow the best app ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Good business concept, but when I book a car, even if the trip confirmation sms received, app still searching for the vehicles. Till the trip completion sms received, no way to know whether the trip is completed or still on",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely safety useful app. Love it. Cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job pick me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been used the service since one year. Good service and we can get the service any time in the Colombo area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very cheap and easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grate,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pickme should ensure that they are enable to guarantee what they say, for example getting a driver's contact details well after 15 minutes is certainly not in accordance to the message they send after a booking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should give more offers and discounts,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I re-installed the pick me app and i couldnt remember  my pass word  but when i followed ""forgot password"" I'm not reciving the temporary pass code sms",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful and great service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really bad app.  Drivers refused to accept my hire from Vauxhall street to Borella.  Three drivers did that. Location does not show properly bad interface.  Very poor app development. Don't recommend this app at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's terrible. It didn't let me even create an account. The app crashed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the drivers cancel the trip if our trip too short.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine but in whatsapp I got a message of your driver thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I bocked a vehicle before 2 weeks but the last time they call me and said sory sir no vehicles in that area, So I'm very helpless..... PICK ME cheated meüò†",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is horrible...they are cheating customers..customer representative s are not supportive.worst level service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a goog app. Thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sri lankan made best APP..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was very helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst app ever. Shows the express way as the route to the three wheel driver. Locations are not accurate at all. Contact numbers of drivers are not even in use. Hated it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first time I called a PickMe 3 wheeler I had no problems. The second time I called a PickMe cab from Java lounge, Jawatte road. The driver phones me back and tells me he was in Fort and it's too far for him to come to where I was! He sounded as if it was my fault that he was called!!! I asked him what he wanted me to do. He tells me to cancel my booking and re-book thru the app. I did as he said. The second driver also phones me and tells me he was too far and couldn't come to pick me up!!! My fault again! I was extremely annoyed! Is it my job to inform the closest driver to come get me? The app was showing several vehicles close by!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
No vehicles every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best app to hail a cab quickly in srilanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its sooo gooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service.... thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drivers are not having sense of humor. Cancelling bookings, if they accept the booking it will cancel the trip is too long from his area or its not satisfied income for each trip. Poor customer satisfaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best App I've seen in SL so far. I didn't find any complications since started using it.  The accuracy of locating the vehicle during the trip should be more efficient.  Overall performance are just Awesome!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would be better if you can reduce the charges. The recent price change is unfair cause there's no improvement in the service. Do we have to pay extra Rs.100 for a trip? It doesn't make any sense at all. I'd rather go by a budget taxi which I have to pay starting prize Rs 50 though. It's worth the prize. Overall this is a good attempt and great concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need more improvements,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nice interface,useful app",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful. Vehicle comes to the door step. Prices are OK.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You guys need to get more drivers out on the road. It's 4.45 on Friday, and I can't catch a single taxi (Three wheeler or mini). There's nobody to take me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have to say many about ur pick  me staffs they are very rude on drivers but we have to think on drivers point of view  some irresponsible customer's booking the taxi for just 1 km and driver have to come 2 km to take the customer ‚ùì  Drivers have big trouble on credit hires not the card hires  some beggar companies hiring the taxi for just 1 or 2 kms that's not fair. ....mostly u the pick me company please kindly handle with the drivers you are so rude with driver's  every day you can get customers but  it's little hard to get good drivers . Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very late process not like uber,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we order driver they chancled it telling it's to big journey and they taking more money  when this app first started the drivers were     good actually I m notagain using this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best app ever made in Sri Lanka. A truly a life saver. Thanks Guys.. this app really helped me saving my money & time. you are doing a good job. Keep it up. (Y),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sri Lankan no 1 taxi app & excellent service........ SUPERB...........!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can u guys please help me to update my new phone number to this app? I have a new number now but the app does not have a option for updating the phone number. It says i have to create a new account with a new Email. I don't want to create a whole new email just to update my phone number to this app. So please add a ""Change Contact Number"" option to your next update. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drivers accepts the booking and cancels the booking when he get a hire from the road... time waster,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some drivers cancelled the trip dt saying they want to cm 2km to pick us,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drivers cancel the trip. It is a big problem. When they cancel same driver is connecred after searching another driver. It is a big issue. Some times app lags.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Top app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good but not much improved,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contacted customer service no response about it and there resend bill feature didn't also work. * Driver cancels trip without even telling us. These are the worst experience i had by using this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Seems very poor architecture. Can't even handle  some amount of requests in evening time with network traffic. It takes more time to book a pick up. Some times location is not working properly, though it is a core function of this kind of application. Worst and time wasting app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unable to login, recover password, prompts just nothing useless",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charges have increased they charge 4 rupees per minute waiting,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday me and my friends ordered a mini van to go to ethul kotte and then we wanted to pick another friend of us from nagavihara so when we told him to stop near nagavihara he just got pissed and told that the hire is finish and he told he can't go hires with us we payed 144rs we won't order from pick me again u guys are so rude to customers üëéüëéüëé,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lacks to mention all rates, most essential part in taxi app. No option to day it is a return (""back"") ride, great influence on rate. Instead they call to ask, cancel, etc. Why have a app if you are going  to call anyway?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used to love this app was a very frequent user but recently Added my credit card for payment. Was charged more. Complained several times no response. Removed the app. Bad customer service. Totally disappointed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is a great app which helped me alot to travel at a fair fee. Had a nice trip..also the drivers are very friendy and punctual,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Incompetent drivers.  Asking for directions. YOU HAVE A MAP.  Driving wrong direction to get more money out of people.  Promo offers 'expire' even when there is no expiry indicated on the card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice n easy app. Very useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's verry passing app.. Order treewheel and any tershus.. Nice there,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good service, but the app is terrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use Pick me often..  This was a very Good Service.. Now it has changed completely. The drivers are very rude in some three wheeler's.    Some cancel the trip w/out notice.   The location indication is inaccurate.. my present location shown are incorrect.  Booking get confirmed - later to find out that the vehicle is around 5 km away.. so have to cancel the booking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is good.but i think travel cost does not see the online it's the one of problem..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Poor service.all the time when i need a taxi,they showed no vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
App gets stuck a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is a must if you are a tourist with local number. Very ease to use and we had no issue during our stay in Colombo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome! !,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Can't reset password  I forgot my password and when I try to rest it the app says my account is invalid and it asks me to register. However, when I go to the registration page it says my account is already exists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super service. Safe. Conveniant,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been using Pick Me for a long time now and quite frequently. No issues. However I reset my phone recently and the app says the current version isnt compatible with my phone anymore. Please provide a solution to this as I use pick me very often.Any way to download an older version?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although I have registered application does not permit me to log-in. I get the message 'You have been blocked',,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Generally, a good service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank's,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb service,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very Useful App,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service by PickMe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The drivers cancel the trip without even informing... this has happened to me several times... pick me has not given me a proper answer yet... why...? If pick me is a service provider why can't they assure a proper service also why is the driver asking for the end destination after accepting the hire...? What is the standard coming to...? Is it because pick me has way too many hires to care about customer...? Please give me a reply on this matter not just email saying u will look in to this matter...,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There are so many issues. When I cancel a trip there is an error ""Trip ID is invalid"" , driver location displays wrongly , Always drivers are asking for the drop location even if I enter the accurate location. Friend of mine went in a TUK, but he doesn't know Sinhala, driver asked about the location in Sinhala and he replied in English but the driver couldn't find the location, instead of that that driver dropped him in a wrong place. He reported it to your support team, but he haven't got any replies from them, route map is showing the wrong path, when I go in a way it's showing that I'm going in the other way.   This is my personal opinion regarding this app :  My rating regarding this app is 2/5 and for the drivers 3/5. Before releasing the app to live make sure to release with less bugs.  1. Location Services should be improved ( Location is not accurate ) 2. Make your drivers comfortable , because all drivers are complaining about pick me, they are your clients . without them you are zero.  3. Give your QA employees proper domain knowledge and training on testing location based apps before asking them to test the app without proper knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app.big time saver for everyday busy life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delay in drivers. Too expensive for every rides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the recent update it doesn't show the book now and book later buttons. Uber is better,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please fix the drop off location. Sometimes it does not locate what we search. TERRIBLE!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App is full of technical problems. Can give evidence for it. Most of the driver don't know the roads and locations in colombo, and worst is some drivers don't have discipline, doesn't know how to talk and complain us for their faults. Customer service team does take  complaints. I had to follow up 3 times and realised that the complaint was not taken down. So spoke to the supervisor. He said he will call back after checking but didn't get back till today and it's been more a year. Drivers lie saying that there is a upgrade of the app and run on the normal metre, charging the same. Uber is the better. You get AC, comfort and pay the rate of pick me taxis for the same origin and destination. My last experience with pick me was an extremely fast driver (i have the video of it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of the drivers don't know the Colombo roads. How is it possible?  Some asking for cancellation due to the distance they have to travel to reach the customers' location. Well, I feel that even though the Uber drivers have the same problem of not knowing the Colombo roads, still they manage to make the trip done via their map applications with the given routes in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best there is in Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average... Not up to the mark!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The experience is really good.  But today a driver told me that they can't see where the customer wants to go.  If they could see it they'd be more happy I guess . Cause he said sometimes they end up going on long runs even when they want just to get back home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is with lots of bugs. Can not set the drop off location and sometimes the app get stuck. Really difficult to use. And takes lots of time to process. I do not recommend this app to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Help full,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome application,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very effective,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best way to travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's repeat asking password ..I forget the password but I could not able to get a new password  ..or any alert from pick me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cannot get verification code.. this is poor.. i had try so many times.‡∑Ç‡∑í‡∂ß‡∑ä..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PickMe would do all the unauthorized credit card transactions and will not take any responsibility to void it or refund you.  Customer care is garbage with lots of stupid people and a manager wouldn't bother coming to the phone to resolve matters beyond agents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is all about traveling and scope is so good. But I've noticed a problem with your implementation. When I switched on flight mode of my phone when I get into sleep, the app drains my phone's battery too quickly. Usualy my phone has 1 1/2 days of battery life. In my battery statistics this app has used 4.52h of total cpu time while phone is in flight mode. Are you sure you have tested your app in airplane/flight mode ? I had 50% battery when I get into sleep after 5 hours its 8%. pickme has used 86% of the total battery power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grate app. Superb.. Really helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very convenient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Full of bugs. The worst it would not allow to enter drop off location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not able to use this service ... it won't let me to register my self in to the application... plz help me for this. if that possible I'll give 5*.. thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cool promotions. I really like this silver time thing. Only problem is you'll need to get permision to use the promo. Will you able to to talk to my wufe please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Succses travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its alright to me:),,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good way of transport, reasonable and efficient",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the Pick me drivers are don't know colombo city roads and places. Sometimes I have to wait more then 10 - 20 minutes. They are not coming to location properly. They are roaming here and there. Pls educate drivers or update app or system. Thanks. These days I'm very annoyed on your team. Because we have to call and guide them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service.. I like,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super app it's very useful to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good work.. but it keeps disconnecting time to time. Pls fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect one :-),,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not bad but need to improve. And app is too slow compared to others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good app I used in my old phone in my new phone I can't login or begin as a new user my email address is not registered so I'm frustrated with the new version plz help me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The app is often slow & gets stuck. Also you should be able to update your phone number in the app. Uber allows this. PickMe does not. To complicate things further you cannot register 2 accounts with the same email address. I had to log into my account on my old phone number & change the email address. Then, uninstall the app. Reinstall it & create a new account with my new phone number. Very exasperating! It's a shame the app is so cumbersome....8 out of 10 times I would use Uber just because the app is smoother! It's a pity...because the service levels are equal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Had this app for possibly close to 3 years now (almost since the day it first came out). I've never seen a cab, even a tuk tuk show up anywhere near me when I try to get one. Always have fallen back to Uber or kangaroo cabs every time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whats this big joke you do with waiting.if the driver brakes for a second.it starts the waiting calculation.in calculation of waiting in tuks or what ever.you shoul be much flexible to give even 30 seconds fare free.then after start the waiting meter on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite of having smaller issues, this is a very useful app to book a taxi. The app is user friendly and convenient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
your waiting charge is so huge. no one charge like that. with this waiting charges now you are equal normal road taxis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two times the driver told that he cannot find my location even when i can see his location.. please fix this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should be able to see your own taxi you booked in different colour or some different indicator because some people don't know the roads that well,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the fu...k any not come to if rain,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app along with great service. One suggestion:  In upcoming trip make an option to edit trip. Otherwise need to cancel and book again for small time changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately has stopped... whats wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi. I can't see the location of the vehicle and even the drivers themselves can't see my location. Please fix this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Safe and easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smooth traveling,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Make the map on the application rotateable and also update the map! Most of the popular land marks aren't visible. And when I enter a drop off location it doesn't recognize it, whereas I can find the place straight away on Google maps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I trust and i like thatdy i am trevelg pick me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To register I gave my Number name and Email ID . and last I pressed done button it's say now check your mail. I checked but I didn't get anything. And app also not allowed to go in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Once I ordered a Tuk and called the driver to tell him the exact location .Then he said he knew it and would come in a minute.But I could see him roaming in the wrong lanes and places. I had to wait 20 mins and at last he called me and said his fuel tank is empty because of all this, as if it was MY fault.After I've said the location clearly,he was still roaming here and there.Please tell your drivers to know the lanes and roads properly and not to put the customers in trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just need  more taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allow pre-booking for less than 2 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
üòÄüòÄ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good,need some improvements. Its quite difficult to simultaneously log in using multiple devices. You need to enter your details again and again provided you use one device as a parent device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheating price for tuks and no better service as before,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great price,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is not working properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please note I traveled by pickme last few days I traveled above 50 km more than 6 to 7 hours I have paid more than 1000/ rupees l feel it's unnecessary charges   I should have taken different vehicles to avoid the waiting charges this is for your information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good taxi service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Buggy... problems with locations.  Never shows actual location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful app. Good‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing bad to tell.fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app is not functioning  when it is connected to WiFi.. I am using android 7.1 I don't know whether its because of my os version but please look into this because I feel this is a critical bug and needs immediate attention...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have just moved to SL and gotten a new number from Dialog. When I try to register my phone number the app comes with an error that the number is already registered. I have sent an email to their support team and have heard nothing back. Terrible customer service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please enter the vehicle colour,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sri lankan number 1 taxi service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting registered is really annoying. Repeatedly asking to fill details. What?  Where?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please enable the option to have multiple drop off locations. For instance if we need to go to Nugegoda and then pick some one and then go to Dehivala it would be convenient if an approximate cost could be calculated for the whole trip. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wonder why am i being charged more on the regular trips I make through your app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useful App. But useless service. Drivers won't come on time.  And they won't come to exact location to pick customers. They""ll stop their vehicle (Tuk Tuk) and ask us to come their point. The reason they say that application got error or location not clear.  The major thing is Devoloper or management not care about customer. They never take any action against drivers. This is own bad experience of mine and my circle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
K,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My location is not fairly accurate, everytime i need to contact the driver and locate him... ex, door # 40 locates as 101",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I use Pickme whenever I can but sometimes this lags and I find it difficult to even confirm a booking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would have been nice if you could arrange to settle the taxi bill through the app. I always have a difficult time finding Petty cash to settle the taxi. Taxi guys will have no change to settle a bill of Rs. 340....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good service I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,

App is unable to locate my location using GPS most of the time. All the time I have to enter my location manually which is really irritating. Also user friendliness of the app can be improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I very love pick me because it is very easy to use and comparable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was doing fine until the past month when i re installed the app. It wouldnt give me a code to log in after i click forgot password. Ive tried and tried and finally got sick of it. Switching to uber because of bad service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Godak hondai,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After requesting a taxi..app is keep saying requesting forever and taxi never arrive :p... Total time wasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has become so bad. Drivers are terrible the service is terrible. One man didn't bother to call and check he got another hire and took off..uninstalling app..moving to Uber. Also your pickme team isn't helpful or responsive. Customer service is terrible. 'Noted' is not the way you respond to a complaint (fb msgs),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,

User friendly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app can't get the location while we are using a public wifi connection. I think new update made this bug. And location search won't give proper location results at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not bad.but some drivers cannot find my location though they are provided with a GPS.Guess ull have to teach them how to use a GPS first.Fares are really fair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this app but give you 2 stars just because of  broken payment method option. It just not working.  I spoke to customer care representative and he told me Credit card payment available only for rides below Rs.2000. But that even doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Within,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quicker system to ride without tension any time of the day,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am trying to get the credit card facility enabled. Talked to the call center several times and still no outcome.  First they said its under payment methods. It wasn't there. Then they said it will appear when I make a booking. It didn't appear. Then they said to uninstall the App and reinstall. Still nothing. Then they said the version that got downloaded is the old version and to update it. But there isn't an update option on the App.     Called again and was told to uninstall & download the Beta version,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time when I need to use this app I have to install it freshly.Next time if I use this app it is not working with the message of unfortunately it has stopped. Very bad new edition of this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pinching with 2 fingers to zoom out the map makes me crazy. It only recognizes one one finger & map goes all over the place. I believe its not a huge matter to fix. But makes our lives that much easy. Wanna see this fix soon before i decide to uninstall this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The app works exceptionally well. I'm a big fan of minimal but clean-quality interfaces and PickMe offers just that! The actual service intended to provide has been nothing but a great experience as well.  A very minor inconvenience is however the small list of drop-off locations suggested for queries. Specifically typing a place may not show any results, and such scenario requires the user to manually pinpoint. Apart from the above mentioned, I give PickMe a solid two thumbs up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cannot set a place properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I daily use pickme  it's  the safest ride i can trust on to go anywhere at anytime . Its so resonable and the drivers are kind and friendly .  With out it i feel so terrible  because  this days most of the taxi drivers are grumpy and some charges are high too its very rare to find a good one.  Please expand  ur service  somemore  because sometimes i too find difficult to find a taxi  i hope because of the high demand .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I open the app it always is just white and only very rarely it opens,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sadly it's still Crashing for me Sony Xperia Z3,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanx for ur service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really very useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like if the taxi location is exactly correct. I would rate this 5 stars if youll keep updating the taxi location very quick and very accurate. Regards....... Senuthi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After booking a mini, the app said that the price is Rs.(390 to 450) but after the ride it said Rs.556. is it a bug or a scam .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usefull,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anytime,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes the wrong pickup location comes and when that happens it's very hard to get the correct pickup location. Fix this and I'll give u 5 star. Other than that it's a really good app. Oh plus there are no vehicles sometimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Downloaded it while on vacation, fair prices and drivers we faced were excellent!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I booked a tuk tuk, and waited. Then app said your tuk tuk has arrived and then it said trip started. App shows my tuk tuk is moving along the road while I still standing in my position. I was wondering and tried to book another. But app doesn't allow for that also. It's OK, every app got bugs. Worse thing is your customer care service. I tried to call , but it was hanging all the time. Absolute useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to reset the password for the app. Everytime it just ask for my email an said we will send a text and that's all. I got nothing at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service. Good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of the tuk drivers call and cancel saying too far. If they are too far, why the hell are they in the map. Poor service",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good driver and good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reliable and efficient service. Design of the app is also really good. All together job well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Been trying to get the app working. But it crashes everytime I try to log in. No use of service without properly working app. A waste in vain. . .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is Suck,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good.but weekends service s are not convenient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wht a great app..very important app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a really great service. Need to improve the number of taxies and add facility to use this service for people doesn't have mobile connection (connected over wi-fi),,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Suddenly doesn't seem to respond on my Samsung galaxy tab s anymore. Even after reinstalling. ""Unfortunately, pickme has stopped""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PickMe has become my go to app for all things transport. Convinient, user friendly, pleasent drivers, reasonable rates. But there has been a decline in the number of taxis lately making it impossible to find one at times. Specially when it's really urgent. And like any business there is a couple of bad seeds when it comes to drivers but 90% of them are pretty good chaps. And almost everyone knows how to navigate to a location without directions now. All in all its a good app wth room for improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loved,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App is quite convenient, but some drivers ruin the quality of service. There is an option to rate drivers right after the trip, but it's good to have an option to give feedback later too. Some drivers are rude and not easy to work with. They don't seem capable of finding places using simple instructions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very convenient to use. Best way to picked up... recomending all to use. Fast and cheap method of travelling. Well done pick me..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its realy help full app. Last one week i took pick me tuk. Its a better experience. Bt you u have to expans this out of colombo area. I cant find taxi in out of colombo area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very useful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really useful app for rides around Colombo Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app is actually pretty great but I cannot pre book a tuk. Please fix it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I booked a van.. last minute driver 'mahesh' called and said he cant come. Very bad customer service because called customer care to launch a complaint but not responding in a proper way. Very dissappointed of your service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please add more vans .. because i need mostly vans but whenever um gonna try it shows #no vechicle#,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey overall your app is really awesome. But the most disappointed part is when you search a place in you map it really suck! Please do something or even atleaset merge with the Google Map search results. We only get few suggestions and most of them are useless. Not even the main landmarks are showing up in the search results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ive also use rhis service but tell the drivers to be frindly...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‚ô•,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have one suggestion for you all. Please add a feature where we can mark important places in the map. For an example house, school, work. Something like a star in the Google maps would do as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wimal√¢rthne,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved it because it is very comfortable to my road as there is no longer threewheelrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crashes after I enter the password ! Please fix it guys ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please send drivers who know the routes ... Do their phones have GPS ? Well they don't wanna use it . the driver stopped the car and went to ""ask for directions"" for 10 mins and came back with no info !!! Then we realized that he hadn't stopped the meter so we were charged for the time he wasted. }:(",,,,,,,,,,,,,
You guys should add the tuk tuk pre booking back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice apps,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I uninstalled tgis app. But they always send SMS to my number. I hate that,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not working at all in the Samsung 8.0 galaxy note tab.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recently my app started to crash continuously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grate service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good and keep move,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually when I try to use it first time, feel little bit strange, because this is the first for sri lankan. Actually it is very fast and cheap when equal to other taxi service. Also we can know the taxi exact location and the details. Nice Work",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app and service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finest taxi app.. super pickups and good navigation. . Nice cheap rates..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good & safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Works perfectly for me. GPS works perfectly on androids, drivers are well skilled and prices are affordable aswell",,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is not working .üò±üò±,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of the staff provide the service as we want. Specially when we are in a hurry, they speed up",,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Very useful app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordered the first taxi on Poson poya holiday.. Arrived in 5 minutes while all other known taxis declined!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the location is off, it holds the first screen while turning on the location. After turning on, it says Fetching Location... and then stops. I can't even see a working app..",,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app very use full... I use this app 100%.. service also 100%üòäüòäüòäüòä.. Good Drivers.. thanks for creativity team and management team... amerko,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App crashes frequently and most drivers still rely on giving them directions despite location service is on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good job,  please try to provide us mini car services too. Most of are 3 wheelers available, anyway this pick me service is safe and secured for the passengers. ...üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëåüëå",,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's so easy to use all drivers are obedient and disciplined,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colombo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um not getting the chode help me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Completely misses the point of satellite guided navigation with maps. Drivers insist on calling and  refuse to come unless given directions. Not worth the aggravation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verification code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great !!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Works for me all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App is good. But it could be very much better i.e having a choice for passengers to pick a 5 star driver, to see traffic, a loyalty scheme etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need to improve a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now service is not much quicker. UBER does well than pickme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Difficult to get a tuk or a mini car in busy time. Some tuk drivers do not responding to the requests. Pick me should add more tuks and mini cars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service is really good... I use it most of the time's. .. but there are a few odd time's where tuks aren't available. . üòï mostly around *11a.m-12 p.m & 1 30-2.30 p.m,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Essential Sri lanken App nowadays,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best app for hire,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Convenient app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is cool guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good app . Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I call driver is in too far or can't come but app show near I think this app just kidding people. .......,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New update is not working, it says unfortunately it stops... So many times installed but still the same.....",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome app!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent service ,some drivers doesn't know the destination, we need to direct them",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good apps,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very helpful and convenient app. I used this once & im very impressed about the service. Even the driver was very friendly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It used to be really good. I could get a mini within 5 to 10 minutes at anytime within Colombo. Then pickme wanted 10 percent revenue as commission from the drivers. Now  'no vehicles' in mini section most of the times and when you book one, sometimes drivers ask to cancel the trip. Only a waste of your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Works as promised.  Drivers are briefed well and courteous.  The app should let users edit and rate their drive  experiences at leisure.  Pick up location editing must also be allowed instead of letting GPS override.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PickMe Service is always reliable and is there in time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most convenient mode of travelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best taxi service,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just clicked n wait vehicle in your door step. No need to waist your money to other vehicles. This price is very reasonable. Other three wheels get 40 to 45 per kilometer. But this 35 great!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New update  have a issue. I can't  open it up . Please make it correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's one of the best service I ever had and all my corporate hires we do with u people.  But how ever we need no nonsense from the driver's to cry about your increased charges on them while we travel or what.  Also I usually take long trips  And when it exceeds 1000lkr the driver's convincing to end the trip and go the rest of the distance without the app.  Which is super annoying.  Please read your warning signs and act fast to illuminate this kind of issues, because we want ur service and we love it...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is good and practical. ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is the update not working properly?  Doesn't show location,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean some 800 odd vehicles have left pick me cos of this... I'm a happy customer of pick me but dude seriously do you guys have to be this greedy?

This taxi service doesn't provide service whenever needed. Requesting for long time. Not accurate. Another so called taxi service. Charges are high even for tuk tuk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr go,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zooming is affected by the update. Cannot double tap and zoom in out. On the rating screen, the stars are all selected and cannot change the rating",,,,,,,,,,,,,
An incredibly useful service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This it to complain regarding this driver ,that he refused the hire  cos it was a short distance hire ,he never called back and mentioned that he can not come ,another driver called be half of him .and KQ6832 said head office said to refuse the hire .  Thought pick me will do a good service but it was at the beginig only the things are better ,if there are drivers who refuse tell them to find another job,we pay them for the hire even if its a short hire .  I hope you'll will improve the service better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just a suggestion.. Please add a option to bookmark locations like home, workplace... Then its easy to set the destination.. :-)  And also I would like if you can provide the UI in sinhala as well...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

U r service realy excellent.  I am traveling the tuk tuk service many. I save my times,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the drivers don't know their way...they have no idea about the routes so they keep on calling us and also take time..  this is not acceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verry good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Server busy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good.but sometimes the driver goes somewhere else,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was very good earlier but not anymore..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gr8 app. So useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I tried to install this app and it asked for permission to access my Camera, SMSs, Photos and other media. No idea why a taxi hailing company needs these. Think you should look into this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/5/2016      3:35 PM            When you update Pick Me why don't you people notify the drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vith good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than budget taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gread,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before the update never faced for issue. Now when I book from my shown location, always get picked up by a person more than 5km away & they have received wrong pick up address. Last few times I had to wait for least 15min from the time of booking for vehicle to arrive. Complained over e mail & phone the problem is the same. More bugs exist but less they have rectified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the most successful apps released in Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love this application.. and they gave fantastic service. . I can't believe it..  All the best pickme..! You have great future ..!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have tried 5 times to use the book later option .. never sends the details on time. Have to call 2 - 3 times to get a cab and then they give you a driver who's far away and he refuses to come.  Very disappointed . Used to be very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really nice service. Always on time. Cool app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your booking later option NEVER WORKED.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best ever..period...you guys have taken Sri Lankans up a another level..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After closing the application still there seems to be a background process running and the app consumes a lot of battery usually happens after I have turned on location n turned it off. I have to un  install or force stop the application all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an awesome app.. Really appreciated the job,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to use this but how its is work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hired taxi from airport to mountlavinia and paid 2700 + 300 toll fee. Limousine asked 45 U.S. dollars and local one asked 4000 rp. I can get cheapest 2300rp with long time dealing. But the car was clean and driver was kind. I like it very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy to use.. batter if there can calculate the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service provided by pick me drivers are very professional. App is also user friendly. I recommend this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some are the drivers are good... and some others dont have proper manner... for a example mr.harun 0755 330228 vehichel no AAJ 5832 he used bad words also...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awasome app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The support staff is amazing! The features of the app are one of a kind in Sri Lanka! Great app! Great service!,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's really useful and now I'm using only pick me taxi. It's safe and cheap fares:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,

Really awesome and so easy for transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful app. Recommended..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great job. pick up address is wrong thats the only problem. correct it and ill giv 5 stars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useful app, but it makes it difficult to choose a dropoff location or manually type in a pickup address (rather than relying on a map-provided address). Also occasionally freezes. Doesn't have the option to pay for trips by credit card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent app!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely useful and convenient,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A great app though the location functionality is limited. It would be great if upon entering a business name it recognised it and retrieved its address. Currently from my use it recognises street addresses only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The taxi driver are kind and patience it's really a good service to us,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can not reset password,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drivers only know how to give stupid reasons to cancel the trip, if they don't want to take the hire.  And make us cancel it",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Time save.  Satisfaction,  No tension Fast service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app. But at times the driver's are rude and refuse to come after accepting the hire. Causing delays for us. And even after, explaining that we will complain to PickMe, the driver said go ahead. No problems. Pickme needs to do something about accepting hires. Other than that, pickme is great. Great service. I'm a well wisher. These are the details as follows.  Reference No. 2122870 Driver Name: Danay Driver Mob: 776247474 Taxi Type: Tuk Taxi Plate No: ABA8997",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome service I love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best taxi hailing app in Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please give a option of canceling a booking. Its important .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything was like clockwork. Welldone pickme team. No hesitation giving you five lovely stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb app. I really like that I can get a three wheel so quickly. I don't need to be telling directions. What a convenience. A must have app if u travel in three wheelers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. 'Book Later' Bookings does not show in the map(live movement of the taxi). 2. Multiple taxis cannot be called. What if the number of passengers are more than 4? My phone is a HTC 816G dual SIM. /// Most drivers doesn't know how to read the map or they just don't use it to save data. When they call many times to ask for directions it's really annoying and the main reason to use this app is gone. Please fix this I will give 5 stars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This app is a must have if u use taxis a lot. Works on time (mostly). A huge step of online transportation. A nice app to have if u are a Sri Lankan. Its really good ,  I didnt have any errors with it. Keep up the good work guys",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome app and the owner of PickMe has pitched the market at the most appropriate time and I think he can do much better what uber and vgo can do in SL. Wish him all the very best to success.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gives me an error when im trying to  login.look into this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never thought I'd see such professionalism from a startup in SL.. Keep up the good work !,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good and cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you for fixing the issues I was having. The app works flawlessly now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is there a specific way to check for the rates in the app itself? Because I couldn't find.. Would be more useful innit if there is a way to check the rates of vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sinhaley stickers on cabs,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It always gets stuck. It also says the taxi is 6 mins away but comes to your destination in 20 -25 mins,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nalla app ondu thambi good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because of the the 'unfortunately crashing thing' always used to appear to me when I tap on the menu button. Please do something for that . Eagerly waiting to rate for 5/5,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No vans.. :-(,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a brilliant app and the begining of a technological revolution in SL. However as we go through a dangerous yet avoidable period of racism i make a kind proposal to request all taxis to remove the 'sinhaley' sticker pasted at the back of their vehicle. As much as I believe in freedom of expression, I believe such controversial means of expressing it are not needed during this period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good service. Quick response. Safer and convenient. Thank you for initiating in Sri Lanka such a service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A reliable app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best taxi app I've used..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good very easy to get 3 wheel in colombo i like  pick me ver much and its very fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely poor service! Drivers dont arrive on time and cancels bookings in the last minute. Customer service number is never answered. App crashes down regularly. Very unreliable and irresponsible!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unreliable. Untrained drivers. Shoddy App,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service was good. Tuks response time is also really fast. Drivers need more knowledge about main Colombo roads. So far so good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A great app....For Sri lankans,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last location should be remembered. Then at least it will start in a location in SL. Please add card payments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Automatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drivers rejecting my trip,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So far it seems to be a pretty good app.. keep it goin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cannot goto profile or any other options. App crashes. Sometimes it crashes when searching for location,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prime app for Sri Lankans in search of a tuk at any time. Amazing service and reliability. Keep it up! :),,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Love this app, very useful, very easy to use and a must have in your phone. Prompt services, cheap and satisfying. Hope you expand your services island wide!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It simply works!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took a taxi. All was well but I had to stop and wait at a location for some time but the waiting time was not getting calculated. Putting a speed threshold would fix this. I felt bad for the guy as he waited like an hour. Gave him a tip but you guys should look into such stuff and fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful app. Would appreciate it if you could allow the customer to have access to the meter through their own phone while travelling with the tuk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I regester didnt receive password reset mail.tried many time but gail to receive mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app crashes when I click on the options tab where you get to review your trips and other stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Estimated time is spot on. Vehicles are available 90% of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome Taxi Service in Sri Lanka.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abdul,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well i use the service almost everyday. And i agree with the comments made on drivers refusing to come saying my location is too far after accepting. Startup the service was awesome and drivers were very polite. But now we see a couple of drivers who maybe shouldn't be serving ur company. I have made a couple of complaints already.. but overall easy to use and super convenient. 3 stars due to above comments made...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The greatest taxi service that i used. this is the best. I bet, you can not feel a better taxi service morw than to ""pickme"" in sri lanka.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
RECOMMENDED!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Damn. It's not working.only display black in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Travel around the Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am using this service continuesly. Driver disciplenes r very poor. Normally when I go I put google maps to see the correct route.  Once a driver took me some long route. When I asked from him he said we can go from this route as well. I knew. But why should I pay more for a poor route navigation?  Pls check this matter and correct it. Or else I have to stop using ur app and never recommend thus app to another person. Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can book only one vehicle at a time.that is a shortfall .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I went on a ride and when I reached my destination the guys meeter stopped. I had to guess and pay. After a few hours I got the sms with the fee. I had paid the guy 100lkr more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service and quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please check the tuk drivers before u give the permission to work under u guys cuz the tuk guy I got last was pretty much drugged and I stopped him halfway and got another one and went. And the nano and the mini car options too. Like the inside of the vehicle stinks soo much and the sweat of the drivers add more to it. It's sometimes a nightmare. :/ but otherwise the service is pretty good and there are pretty good drivers too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm really  like this...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professional service! And easy to use. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pre booking sucks!!!u cannot plan any proper rides,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
V good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supper,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reasonable rates and good discipline drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharada,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice and convenient service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rides r gud bt i hope u chk the drivers quality* and discipline,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very convenient. One issue is the fact that drivers (sometimes) accept and subsequently cancel bookings because it's ""too far"" for them. Isn't distance something they can check before accepting? If this didn't happen, getting a taxi would be a lot faster in some cases. Five stars if it's worked out!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good but cant book 2 vehicles at once hopes it solves,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a really good app. But I tried to book more that one taxi at a time. Couldn't make it.. So hope this option will also be able to be added..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Project Cinnamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COLOMBO,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing for the old auntys and better for us and also safer,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After update it is always showing wrong location and having problems on location. Improve this fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On note 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doesn't work beyond fetching location,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saves both time and money,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently the app was running smoothly and reliably. But since the latest update I can't access the user menu in left hand side. Every time I touched the menu icon, app stopped working. PLEASE FIX...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very nice app and it has make travelling easire. But get stucked sometimes. The drivers complaint that the device is not working and can't go to that meter. Doesn't show all the available vehicles in the map.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app was working fine till last update. Unfortunately, the last update made fonts too small. Vehicle tracking is not working properly. Please fix. I will give you more stars after you do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fetching location. Doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
face book,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never went any further!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The application and the service is brilliant. ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The app doesn't work on my note 5 it says fetching location but it gets stuck on that screen. Please fix this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app is pretty snappy and fast. I would give it 5 star but it gave my gps coordinates slightly wrong to the driver and directed the driver to the next lane to pick me up. This delayed my trip by an additional 5 minutes. But i was able to call the driver and direct him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly developed system and very good service. Pick me is the best taxi company in Sri Lanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awsm service ‚òÜ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice app,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Love it! Really cool!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Works like a charm. Never disappoints. Keep up the good work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supper....!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than other taxis,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every time we have used it we got 101% service. Great app!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Superb and perfect service on time,also lovely timing,driver also profesional friendly manner,im impressed on this,hereafter only at pick me",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have used this app to find tuks in colombo several times. App is good and the drivers are also professional most of the time. Great if you can include CC payment option as well. Also increase the number of vehicles. And start fetching location from last known position. In that way the app will start quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't even use the app. it just keep crashing and crashing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New update is not working. No vehicles available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Truly the smartest way to travel in Colombo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The progress dialog stays open for a while. Dismissed it self a while layer but no code. Can't proceed. Bad review till you fix this. I'm running android marshmallow,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Requesting verification code...forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are providing best excellent services.may all your endeavors are met with huge success and appreciation. Tomorrow's sri Lankan have bright future. My Best Wishes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today I had my first cab service with the app. It worked perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Updated app is not working in a Tab.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Was never a fan of Taxi Hailing Apps before. Today early morning I was all but lost for any means of transport and my mum helped me out with ""PickMe"".  I was blown away by 1) the professionalism shown by one of your Tuk drivers just now and 2) the ease and availability of vehicles even at 3am. So I've decided to use ur app. Hope the standards will remain the same if not better. Though I am too a bit curious as to why u need permissions to access my images, camera, connections and call info.. :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep it up..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best app for sl,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very helpful for foreigners. Just love it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good way of transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awsom,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The service is great, but have one issue, why does this app needs this much of permissions? For example accessing the SD card? n modifying the content? Read phone status n Id? Direct call  phone numbers? View WiFi connection? I hope u'll make an effort to explain the exact means of using these permissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome app. Works really well. Pin point accuracy. Reliable. Easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great App, easy to use and really like the new pic me later feature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's so useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Work fetching but cannot find my location,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love it the app and the service. But it needs to improve the range. There are so many drivers on galle Road and the busy commercial places but very few in other areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really helpful at times,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veary use full,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ordered taxis 3 times using this app and the service was amazing.. Decent drivers and the cabs dont stink.. So I will continue using this app and I hope you will keep up the high standard.. I did not come across any issues with this app..simply amazing and fast service.. Thanks alot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just makes life easy :)...Job well done :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used it last week to ride to the airport! Amazing and paid 25% less than my usual airport ride! Very happy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gayan,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But driver cheated me during last journey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Works perfectly :D,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple and convenient..keep up the good work peeps,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I once used the app for a trip and loved the service ever since. Perfect and excellent customer service experiences. Thank you guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goood,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can't download. Error code 491,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and only,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Affordable and adorable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The no 1 taxi hireing service I love it . üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a good application.. the drivers are also friendly.rates are cheaper than the normal tuk.  only thing you need a strong internet connection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well its a great one,keep up working. Show more improvmnts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It says I have to update Google services to use the app and when I try to update Google services, phone says no space. Also removed a few of my fav apps to get space. But still the phone says no space to update Google services. Hence, no pick me up for me :'(",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lowest fares I have ever seen!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will be great if you keep up the good work. :-),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service and convenient,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job folks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very use full app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as i installed the app. Clicked book now. Wow within minutes the vehicle has arrived. Superb!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All we need is a good design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful and extremely helpful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very reasonable fares. Would love to see this grow into more and variety of vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the good app & most useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its damn great...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please fix the problem with ride estimate...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But ..still need more Tuks inside Colombo ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best taxi hailing service in Sri Lanka. Reasonable fare and accurate calculation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But need to be improved a lot. First it doesn't have enough taxis. In Colombo it shows around 15 taxis. Booknow button is too much straight forward. Even if you press it mistakenly it goes as a booking,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Help full,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app. Great service. Keep up the good work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent and quick service!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You say you have updated your app but I don't see any difference. If you guys don't have enough vehicles don't mention it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy way to find tuk in mid night,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Need Some improvements. And also Sinhala fonts are not showing in some devices..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This thing doesnt work properly on ma phone. .cant look where tuks are..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best taxi apps around, but be wary of drivers who use the regular meter instead of the mobile. Put a complain the Last time but didn't get any feedback. 5 stars if they respond to complaints",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take time to start up . Same time it's not working,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pick me is a very easy of booking my taxi on my fone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's. Great. Travelling.  With. Pickme,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy way for travel....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Didn't think that this would be as useful as it eventually turned out to be. Great idea, awesome app!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old the very best,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I tested your system on Sony Xperia miro. But I unable to enter the verification code. Verification text box is not visible. Because that activity is not enable the scrolling. Sony Xperia miro screen size is 3.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its good app for people,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very nice facility,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good work ‚ù§üëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would be amazing if the customer got  the amount of the trip by mseg before before the rate the driver tab pops up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy to get taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app has real good potential and hope it will be used by a wider community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app to travel safe anywhere you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome  üëç,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PICKME IS DOING GOOD WITH ONLINE TAXI.KEEP IT UP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This application proved to be very useful. Calculated the fare nicely. Pickup was very quick.  At the moment no ideas on how this could be improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
",....",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's no place to enter the verification code.... :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good. No complaints for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow I like it fine. .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A few more tweaks to the app and I'll give it 5 stars :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
good service in srilanka,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This service is call real ONLINE TAXI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prety good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thought it was complicating at the beginning. But it turned out to be very easy üëç also try to add scheduled time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GPS accuracy needs to be improved,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app was recommended to me by my friend. I have nothing else to say but perfect for my travel requirement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app. Very quick service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were some bugs in the beginning but as they say nothing is perfect at its launch . It's a very convenient app recommend it to every person out there who travels a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a useful app for people who travel by tuk tuk often. Rates are ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very useful app. And rates too very reasonable. Please introduced this to more vehicle outer Colombo too. Some times hard to find a vehicle from outer Colombo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It even got a customer care. Amazing work. Keep up the good work,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had a few difficulties thou creating an account with the keypad active so cudnt see some of the fields when trying to enter data in them,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accurate location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parameswaran,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app! Cabs arrive quickly and very reasonable price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's fast becoming a trend to among tri drivers to use the app to attract clients, and then insist that the app has a problem and charge the client the rate of a normal metre. App is of little use if all it does is find you a ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely love this app. A very useful app I must say and a much needed one. We don't have to spend money on telephone calls and have to wait for a taxi to turn up. GPS solves the giving directions issue. Very convenient and I absolutely love this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm using a Huawei Honor 3c. I installed the app, but it is having issues in fetching the pickup location. I tried in several locations. I did re-install as suggested from support hotline, still the issue is same. I tried by entering the address manually, but it doesn't accept it. Please fix asap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's just awesome to get a tuk fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the idea and I love hailing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most convenient way to book a taxi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plenty of room for improvement though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great App,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great app for travel in SL (mostly Colombo for now). Works pretty well...pretty accurate on timing the arrival of a vehicle and you get decent drivers. Very useful. More vehicles need to be added to the vehicle pool I guess, so that at any given time, you'll have a couple of vehicles around. Overall...job well done in making the ordinary Lankan commuting life easy üòä",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best mobile app ever to get a taxi :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Useful but the pick me meter is often inaccurate. GPRS in the hired vehicle sometimes goes heywire and as a result the pricing is always different. The drivers themselves accept that pick me doesn't work always and hence put their meter on and does not fuss when we calculate the sum and pay. However some do not agree and the difference is sometimes over LKR500. Absurd. Please fix this as a continuation of this would mean we would rather go back to the usual cab companies despite the lengthy time period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best App to book cabs quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could not register becuz I can't see password field. Crapy user experience...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fastest way to book a cab for me. Good service and nice app. Love it! Saved my day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Love the app. It's the first thing I get on when I need to hire a taxi for the everyday traveling within the city.  The services are responsive, reliable, and quick.  Highly recommend this app",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nice app. but if  can make it display the amount, waiting time and distance traveled. it will be more trust worthy. And at times we don't get the amount after the tip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome app. The difficulties faced when booking a cab is now to the past. Thank you pick me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Punctual service and will recommend do everyone. Surely its the smartest way to book a taxi!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expand the amount of ur vehicles island wide,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"service was really satisfying and the app works perfectly fine.but I am using this app for two weeks now and still my trip history hasn't been updated in my account. And also when I go to my profile it shows empty. If you could add the fee calculator in to this app, the user experience will become more higher",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need more improvements. User credentials sent through clear text. Quickely patch the issue. Good luck guys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tried it yesterday, awesome app. Convenient and hassle free service. The tuk arrived on time despite being a busy hour. Will definitely use again, already recommended the app to friends and family. Big thumbs up to PickMe!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome app,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used it today at 7am to work. The taxi was in front of my home bfore I knew it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Developers please have a look, appears not working with Android devices. Getting ""Sorry we are unable to retrieve your current location""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe you guys can convince other taxi operators to use this service and close down their hopeless call centers. This can be the uber from Sri Lanka.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this..great app..used this today and was cheaper than others as well..thumbs up PickMe,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall excellent service, very polite driver I have met ever(Very good guidance training given to them)  and app work fine on my nexus 5 lollipop 5.1.1. These are just small improvements for your greater service. Please ask the drivers to remove the existing metre or switch off the metre if they are hired via pick me. Please add new feature to show the running bill on driver's app as well as customer's app. Hope you guys consider these points.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does not work on my phone. Meizu M1 Note with a Meidatek chipset. The GPS shows position correctly on map but message says unable to retrieve pickup location. please FIX!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good idea, keep going",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've used it once.. And I was actually impressed! Keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi this is a very useful application and a great idea. However we would appreciate  if you guys can indicate the rates of your service through the client application before booking and show the meter (rate) of the trip while moving as we have no idea of the cost until the end of the trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App charges for waiting even while taxi is on the move... Adding an extra 45/- to my total...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app made my life easy and safe, just love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am unable to log in or register since it does not send me the verification code though it says it has. It sounds like a good app and I would love to use it but I can't. Please fix the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most awaited app is here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful app. Appreciate their service. Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Says finding location for almost an hour,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Verification code says mismatch when I type in the code and confirmation of the code,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is good but the price is too high comparing to fair taxi. If you can have the same rate as fair taxi you will get more hires. And I will be able to promote you guys as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook login as the current procedure can be a hindrance to new users. Reset password page does not work. Asks for mobile number but the input box is titled email address however neither works so I can't login.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am highly unhappy that you'll are accessing the other media on my phone. Just because u want a profile photo doesn't mean you have to access the entire media. You should have it as an option for people to set a photo. I can really use such service as yours, but you'll need to think about privacy rights a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
For Samsung Gallaxy S Duos,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great and convenient app!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is really good app. To find a taxi is very easy. No need to call any call center. I highly recommend this app. One more thing. Please add Google directions to that app.for now it's have some small issues. So hope you guys do some changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But why do u need permission to access my media n camera,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb thinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only way it could be better is if we can see the fare while we're on the trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best taxi app in Sri Lanka!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looks like everything is good. Great update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got the taxi within a couple of minutes. Highly recommend this to all who are out there. Give it a try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good job guys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Glad someone performed the rather herculean task of getting this done.  Quick question,  will there be budget tuks in the future (like faremetretaxi) or will it probably stay at standard rates? EDIT- I would love to see you guys expand and have your own line of Tuks and other vehicles!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Was concerned regarding why the app needed camera permission. PickMe responded back quickly, saying its to upload the profile pic. Happy to see quick replies, wonderful app !",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got my tuk within 5 mins. Good work guys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome !,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app. Awaiting eagerly for future updates! This can only get better,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tried on the Web as well as from the app. Also, why does this app require permissions to camera and gallery?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im unable submit the form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super fast response and arrival.. Love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App requires a bit of improvement. But the service is excellent.. Had my first ride with driver rohana and it was great.. He also explained clearly the full process of how the system works and was also very excited about using a new technology and being one of the first to adopt it.. The fee calculation is also accurate.. Was 5 bucks less than the usual meter rate.. Hats off guys.. Fix the app and ill give 5 stars..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just add one more confirmation just after showing the taxi details and before sending out the order to the taxi fellow. I was just testing the app and a taxi got booked soon after it found and displayed the taxi info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A much needed application, nice interface. Watching my hired taxi moving towards me in the phone is awesome..Gud luck guys..",,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's really an awesom app to use hail a taxi in srilanka. Its a new era in srilankas technolgical growth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow ! Come on srilanka is growing day by day ... A wonderful app to fulfill the traveling need.. Definitely evryone should have this app..thanks for the wonderful app .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wow!! Such a wonderful App..easy to use, very user friendly interface...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Superb  superb taxi service.......lovely and user friendly  interfaces.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow! It's so much easier to get a taxi now with this app! Interface is super!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something new to srilanka. It will make people life easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the interface and the flow to hire a taxi .. Very user friendly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
