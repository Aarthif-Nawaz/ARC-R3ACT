I'm not getting the pickme points anymore. can you'll fix it,get shall fix 
This app has big issues and after today I might stop using it all together. The most important thing to fix is for the user to cancel a trip when the driver already marked the user as inside the car. One driver racked up 17000lkr of fees as he didn't mark the trip as finished in his app. Had I been able to mark it as ended it would not have been such an issue. The original trip was for 200lkr,app big today stop important thing fix user cancel trip driver mark inside car lkr finish able end issue original

"Terrible. I needed a ride from a remote area to the airport at 2am, so I used PickMe's ""Book Later"" feature to schedule a pickup (10 hours in advance). I promptly received an SMS confirming my booking, and the details were also listed in the app under ""My Trips.""  2am came around and there was no car in sight. My booking magically disappeared from the app, with no cancellation notice, in spite of the confirmation they sent me earlier.  No one answered their customer support phone number or email address at the time and still now, a full day later.  I could've missed my flight but luckily I found a local taxi company that was still open and agreed to take me.  What a disastrously poor service. If you need a reliable transportation service that will be there when they say they will, I suggest you look elsewhere.",terrible ride remote area airport book later feature schedule pickup advance promptly receive confirm list app come car sight booking magically cancellation notice spite confirmation send no customer support phone number address time day flight luckily find local taxi company open agree disastrously poor service need reliable transportation suggest look

"The app works exceptionally well. I'm a big fan of minimal but clean-quality interfaces and PickMe offers just that! The actual service intended to provide has been nothing but a great experience as well.  A very minor inconvenience is however the small list of drop-off locations suggested for queries. Specifically typing a place may not show any results, and such scenario requires the user to manually pinpoint. Apart from the above mentioned, I give PickMe a solid two thumbs up!",app work exceptionally big fan minimal clean quality actual service intend provide great experience minor inconvenience small list drop specifically place scenario user manually pinpoint apart solid

Its a good app but the thing I hate about this app is that most of the time there are no vehicles to catch. During emergencies its so annoying. and I have never gone in a budget taxi cuz all the time it says drivers are busy. If you can add more drivers this app would be great. And also the price rates should be watched some are pretty unreliable. though am a loyal customer I get only a few offers. and also you all might have to add more bikes not only in Colombo area buy also in places dehiwala,good app thing hate time catch annoy go budget taxi busy add great price watch pretty unreliable loyal customer area buy
