"Not in the area I reside, otherwise great specials"
Nice
Was very good and right on time
Bs don't install
Poor delivery
I did not receive the food .I am going to buy a second food.Please reimburse me for the 1st one that I didn't receive.Rachel Obas.
Worst
Good
Crashes all the time
Excellent offers and fast delivery
"when finishing an order, the order did not give notification that it went through. placed another order and the same thing happened. a minute later, both orders were up and there was a $10 cancellation fee for both. awful service"
I agree the app has not been the same in a while.
Fast and friendly
Ordered for the first time.. always showing issues with the card. I would give zero star. Such a shame.
Last service was a mess. My order never arrive. The driver was around all Miami because in the restaurant they was preparing my food. When finally he going to do the delivery he was at least 20 minute far of my house. Near to my place i receive the notice my order is cancel after 1: 20 hour waiting.
"My problem with Uber eats is that they do not verify the people receiving the food properly. Even though I have was given a refund that will be put back in my account for maybe 3-5 business days, someone got a free meal off of me!!!! What about the time that was robbed from me along with my food????"
Quick response
I love the convenience of it all
Great service
I'm a platinum rewards member and I can't even get decent support on an issue for my account. Very unhappy since I've been a user for years and it's my primary mode of travel. Guess I'm switching to Lyft.
Forget it. The app is ok the crews and delivery stink. I'm canceling my monthly membership. It doesnt work as promissed.
"Horrible customer service, was ignored by multiple representatives regarding an order! I do not recommend this app, UberEats does not value their loyal customers and will not refund you for food that you never recieved! I paid good money for good food and the logical solution to failure of service is to refund which UberEats carelessly and unprofessionally rejects to do. Use DoorDash, GrubHub, Postmates, literally any other app than this one! Very upsetting!"
"For someone who doesn't currently have a working vehicle, and enjoys dining out, this app is perfect. I've used it for a while, have friends and family who use it, and it's pretty good. There's a wide variety of places to choose from, and I like the fact that I can tip directly from the app. I also really like the fact that it shows me what the driver looks like, their name, and what car they drive. Definitely going to keep using it."
Phenomenal
Map correctly recognizes address but sends driver down to wrong place. Have updated address and deleted account with no fix.
Eh it's okay $$
Easy as.
Buen servicio
Ha mejorado bastante en cuánto a la oferta de restaurantes y el que vengan los pedidos completos.
Great delivery app!
Tried to order food and it kept saying there's an error. After a half hour of trying I was still not able to order food.
Fast efficient tried all the food delivery aps this one is the best
"When I was in India, it was working completely fine. But outside India it's not working at all."
Excellent job
"Install app. Asks me right away for phone number, then. Ode, then email and then it says email already has account but no other options to sign it etc. Unistalled immediately."
Won't let me look at the reviews of restaurants before ordering. Waste of money when the food sucks.
Driver drove on my grass. I just got it resodded. My husband wasn't too happy with that.
Great Experience!
My order was wrong I ordered the chicken sandwich combo. And the combo comes with one side and a drink. The side I ordered was Cajun rice and the drink I ordered was Mirinda Strawberry. This is what was delivered to me the chicken sandwich and french fries. I ordered from popeyes.
Prices for delivery have sky rocketed over the past few months. What used to be afordable occasionally is no longer worth it. My recent order that would have cost $50 if picked up balooned to $72 for delivery. I will no longer be using this service due to the cost.
Great app. Nicely laid out and easy to use. Really good selection.
"Best and worst app ever!! does nothing to stop me from ordering food wherever whenever on impulse😂😂 Never had a bad experience, awesome delivery people, smooth customer service reps. I now budget for uber eats lol"
App is simple to use and works well
Was alright till a recent update. Now its a bit buggy
Wont accept paypal (Canada) Forcing people to use credit cards isnt cool.
Wow love the app amazing idea I don't have to go and get it my self.
"Made the order and when is to pay it says place is out of the reach of my house, 2nd time same thing. And both places on a 10 block radious"
It's an inexpensive service in comparison to the alternatives however I often receive orders with missing or incorrect items though I do believe that is more on the communication within resturants than the app. However when I address it...it never seems to be a pleasant interaction.
My orders consistently missing items and it takes extremely long to receive your food when there is even a driver available so its rarely warm.
"Since I updated the app 2 days ago it fails a lot, asks evey time for address, didn't let me make checkout, etc."
I can't even register. It wont accept my cell number but it will the example. It keeps telling me my account doesn't have a password. And I still have to rate with a star..
"I'm in rothwell Leeds Ls26. And the app seys it ""coming soon "" yet uber eats website delivers to mee!! Please sort this out ASAP!!"
So far so good.
Cool
"Disgusting term and policy, not help at all!!"
The wait time for food is ridiculous!! If both my sons weren't sick I would've went and gotten my own food!! Almost 2hrs for some damn popeyes really!!
App freezes and doesn't let me place multiple orders at a time
Excellent
Can never orders food smoothie there's always an issue and then there's no one to help you out with your issue and the customer service Representatives on the chat are so rude
Sometime you can get free delivery with a order which is towards your destination! Competition didn't have such feature. The app is very clean and working perfectly.. Never had any problems!
Great
Supposedly a big company and they can't have an in app refund like just eat will not use again just eat is cheaper and way better service
It is not working for me since I got a new card. Cannot purchase any food. Really disappointed in the service. Supposed to be a professional service but clearly is run by a bunch of absolute gimps. Not happy.
I couldnt live without you guys i cant cook so basically uber eats is my wife! Love you guys keep up the good work.
Great and timely pleasant
"Will consistently mess up your orders and take no responsibility for their part in the service. Customer service when they get back to you is rude and less than helpful. Drivers will get lost, make multiple deliveries at a time and have no clue which order is yours. Save yourself the headache and use another app."
Great.
"Slow. Waited over an hour just to not receive my food. Then they say I cant get a refund for an order I never received. Never using Uber again. Use Doordash, the people are easier to work with and aren't as incompetent as Uber employees and drivers"
Love this app
the best app ever
Great app
Great variety of Restuarants! Always EXCELLANT service!

Very bad customer service! False advertisement. Big disappointment. Do not recommend.
Update 3/9 I would recommend for anyone thinking of downloading this app to not do so. Simply you cannot even call anyone other than the driver when something has gone wrong. More often than not something does go wrong. Do not download. 12/19 Hey so recently tried using the app again after some time of not using it and honestly it's garbage. You can tell there a severe disconnect between UberEats and the restaurants. Combined with all of the surcharges and extra fees it's honestly not worth it.
Stop SMS spam
Slow service. They don't address complaints
They not in all areas
I would like to inform you that your Subway options always change the orders and what vegetables you want on your items. After we always select we always recieve something different than we order.
Glitches
"Ce site est tout simplement une ARNAQUE !!!!!! Ça fait 1 semaine que je me bat avec le service client pour me faire rembourser d'une commande qui n'est jamais arrivée. La seule réponse que j'ai, est que j'aurai du vérifier si mon adresse était correcte et rester à côté de mon téléphone. Il me prenne pour une débile, car l'adresse que j'ai renseigné est bien évidemment la bonne et que si j'avais reçu un appel du livreur, j'aurai eu son numéro de téléphone et j'aurais été en mesure de le rappeler"
"Easy to use. Never an issue directly with uber eats, just restaurants."
I had a order get canceled but I still got charged. How do I get my refund since my order was canceled?
Very bad experience with Uber as a whole. Very frustrating at times. The app just gets downgraded every time there is an update. Certainly not what it used to be
I could not set my new account
I'm very pleased with this app so far. Great job
"The app will change your order without you knowing, the drivers are either late or don't ensure they even have your order not someone else's when they go to pick up and deliver, and the customer service representatives are a joke to try to deal with. They are a hassle to try and fix anything and when you are charged fees wrongly, they would rather take your money and give you their ""app credit"" instead of your money back. Don't waste your time."
Excellent
"More often then not my food comes either incredibly late, not at all or subpar quality. Alas I still use the app for I have no vehicle :("
Excellent
"Good people good food, papa johns"
Good overall. Just pricy!!$$$$$. Ridiculously pricey sometimes. And the small order fee is so stupid!
Muy bien.
Always great and super helpful from work and having kids makes eating out hard
"Great to use, more deals appear everyday."
"All drivers should deliver to the door, but they don't."
You should give your existing customers more discounts.
App is unusable.
"Your promos are misleading. I ordered from a special menu with a label ""Buy 1 Take 1"". I purchased 2 items and only received 1 of each to think that I was ordering from a buy 1 take 1 menu. Who would buy 1 pc of each item from a ""buy 1 take 1"" menu? A total scam."
App we'll done usually missing maybe some feature from Uber itself like share a meal so everyone pay their part and order what they want.
Love it.... all very easy to use sometimes I wish we would get more discounts for the people who use the app to eat
Great service. Amazing!!!
Good
"I waited almost an hour for an order, but a driver never went to get the order. I called the restaurant but they hadn't made the order yet due to no one had showed up but UberEats still charged me for the food when I cancelled. I'll never use again. I'd rather use Doordash."
"La app es buena, rápida y cumple su función, pero podrían mejorar la comunicación cliente-repartidor"
"Customer service not straightforward with an issue of a past order, app said order delivered but never received"
I can not login
The best
Falla bastante con respecto al GPS.
Does the job never had any problems with the app
Great. Love Mcdonalds delivery service although it's annoying when they make the service unavailable. Wish it wasn't so expensive for delivery.
I love this app 😍😍😍😍 ok not that much 😂 but they have McDonald's and I love them
"Why can't I turn off notifications for special offers? I turn the notifications on so my watch will tell me when an order is arriving soon but then my watch starts buzzing for some mystery promotion that is just a thinly veiled way to get me to open the app around lunch time. Why is the app pushing special deals then saying I can't order them? If my location is too far to order from a restaurant, I shouldn't even see the restaurant in the app! Uninstalled."
Horrible customer support. I'm here in mexico using this app and I cant find someone to speak in English to help me I've been jipped on over 2 orders and nothing has been done on my situation. 03/09 finally uninstalled this app. After being a VIP member also will be uninstalling UBER.
Why was it cancled????
very happy with this service and use it often!!
"Uber Eats backs restaurants, failing to protect consumers, which makes this a service I cannot count on and will no longer use. Their job as the facilitator is to insure fair transactions. They've failed to do so multiple times and have lost our business as a result."
"I joined 2 days ago and have ordered twice in as many days. I injured myself and can't walk or drive. It's been 8 days and doesn't look like I will be mobile at least for another week. I found Uber Eats, joined immediately, and all my orders have been within 30 minutes and exactly what I ordered. This is the best for anyone in a tight spot, too busy or who just doesn't want to deal with going out. I'll be using Uber Eats again today. I highly recommend to this app."
Uber eats are disgraceful. Orders get cancelled constantly but only after they make you wait hours first. Customer service is absoloutely shocking and completely unhelpful. Overall terrible experience. Edit: I tried to contact your support like you asked and received the same basic response as last time where they basically ignore everything I've said even though i stated that i was asked to get in touch by yourselves. You may have to contact me or provide a link to a contact number.
Easy app great service
OK
Lots of promotions....thanks...
worst customer service experience unprofessional lazy auto reply
"After the last update the app is messed up. Hangs a lot, loading issues, and often closes itself completely."
Love its easy to use and good if don't have transportation. It can be a little costly
I ordered a small vanilla ice cap at 2% milk and I got a chocolate milk ice cap.
"Comanda anulata, ca sa nu beneficiez de promotie. Nu recomand."
Good service and polite behavior
Good App
Easy access to food and very great service
Since update this app doesn't work. Can't even get past adding address stage. Worked fine for years before
Ok. A lot of places cancel me because they are out of stuff etc. Not very convenient if ur busy working person.
"UberEats consistently disappoints me. Multiple times I've had rude delivery people, cold food, unexplained delays without any apologies, oh and you can't cancel once they're delayed! That only proves how aware you are of this issue. I would highly recommend just walking to whatever store you want to order from because it'll still be faster and a better experience than what UberEats provides. To the copy paste customer service reply below: I did. Your system either deleted it or you ignored me or you're taking your 5 days to respond after you've already charged my credit card. This is a consistent issue in multiple different countries. Your system clearly isn't working."
"Loved it, went from first install to food in like 45 minutes! Epic!"
"Disgraceful, half of order and no one to contact..."
Nicesu
Most always use this app the delivery fee a bit high but theres promotion that help with that.
Made things easier😍
Its my last time ordering i ordered something wrong and it has been an hour for me trying to cancel it so i'm getting something i dont want because i don't know why shall it be hard to cancel an order
"So far, I've only actually used the app once- this was on two Big Mac meals, one thick shake and a MacFlurry, and, all for just the price of delivery!! By using the- ""UP TO £10 OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER- (not including delivery charges..)"" was quite shocked by how much Macdonald's charge for deliveries.. almost £4!! however; my food arrived within 10 mins and that's all I had to pay so I was ok with that!!!‐ Emails send deals every month, it's a gr8 app!"
"Today the app keeps asking for my address, getting a blank screen, i haven't had any problems using it before, everything is uodated"
"Only used a few times,they keep saying sorry for the delay...it doesn't happens often they say.....YES IT DOES."
Good app with good selection's
"They want you to put in your phone number to ""get started"". I've never had an Uber account. Period. I've had my phone number for just over a year, and never used Uber. Ever. But whoever last had my number, did have Uber and the phone number is still associated with their account. So I can't use the app because there isn't an option to sign up with my email, and I know from prior experience with my boyfriend trying to become a driver there's no such thing as proper customer service at Uber."
"Took 2 hours to get food from a few blocks over, could've walked there and got it faster. The convenience of having it delivered is completely not worth it, wasn't even, it was a headache knowing that I'm paying a fee and a tip for an inconvenience to me."
Love this app so much it saves my life when I'm at work
Always payment method problems comes when i placed the oder that big worst bug in this app
Pretty good sometimes glitches
I'd appreciate it if uber eats would add more options but otherwise i like the app i guess
A veces no salen todas las opciones de restaurantes.
I cant order food from my credit
Awesome
"Such a ripoff. Service fees, delivery fees plus an increased food cost because they charge the vendor a % so they have to jack up pricing. A typical order is usually $12-15 more than pickup, before tip. Only way I'm ever using this app again is if I'm bedridden."
I ordered some food and the driver picked it up then cancelled the order and drove away with $56 worth of food ((it was for a party)). I called customer support and they even checked and confirmed that he never even came to the designated location. Honestly they should be able to check so to avoid situations like this bc i was pretty angry when it happened. Giving it 3 stars bc they offered me a $5 off coupon as compensation so i guess it makes it hurt a little less.
Gonna miss User Eats! ❤️☹️
Uber eats doesn't recognise me or my Login details
"very professional, on time, lots of promos, reliable. I will be a forever ubereats fan! 👍👍👍"
"Food usually comes on time, hot and correct. And i love the variety of places you can order from"
Nobody wants to help you when Uber eats shuts down your account for no reason! You lost a loyal customer because you don't value me as a customer
App is okay but delivery fee is ridiculous
Best
excellent
Great App for regular use💙
Great service
good
Bad app
Didnt bring my food and refused a refund
It's a hit and miss I get really mad when they dont get my straws like I have to click utensils in order to get it if there's a drink they should just put it in but other then that it's awesome time saver for after long days after work and I dont feel like cooking
Shaikhsabirali Good
Terrible made app it's always got some bug that makes it annoying to use. This week it's the not being able to schedule orders. There's always a problem on ubers end whether it's late delivery or if it shows up at all. They are happy to take your money instantly but when they fail to deliver it takes 3-7 business days. Support staff have the intelligence of a potato if you can even get in contact with someone.
Fast delivery
Good
"More than 1 hour delay isn't nice especially when you have business to do besides eating, like catching a flight etc . Trying to deliver quality instead of quantity would be highly appreciated by your clients ."
ممتازه و التوصيل سريع
എനിക്ക് ഇത് ഇഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടു ഒരുപാട്
"Hice un pedido, me aburri de esperarlo hasta que me dormí, me desperte para enterarme que lo habian cancelado, entiendo que no es culpa total de la app, pero debería prevenir esas cosas, sancionar establecimientos que no cumplen o en su defecto ofrecer una compensacion por el error a sus usuarios."
Sad uber service taken by zomato
The best food delivery apps.
Drivers do their best but unlike uber itself you cannot pin your location. The app wrongly assumes that the address you put in is in the correct location. It results in the drivers and customer quite stressed. There is no enter manual address like the uber app.
Deleting as the Eats app no longer works for me and the advised steps for resolution don't work/appropriate help options don't exist. Trying to get assistance is near impossible. Will stick to other apps from now on.
Fast and efficient
Fantastic! Food was delivered quickly and was hot and tasty.
So far so good! User friendly! Quick delivery!
The app only gives an error that location can not be found and is stuck only showing the address bar. Nothing else shows up.
"Usually fine, but they are impossible to get in contact with when anything goes wrong with an order."
"Great app, only issue is the limited payment options. If they had an EFT or something of the sort for those people who can't link cards."
Drivers cancel your order just to eat your food. Customer service from India is terrible.
"When I start the app , it confirms the delivery address and then take me to zomato"
after installing Uber eats it tells me to redirected to play store and install Zomato.This is absolutely not good at all.
Very good
Very bede
"AVOID disappointment as Lazy UBEREATS Demands customer come to collect!! Delivery man wouldn't deliver to the door, because of their bike. I was working and it was a surprise for me but knew there was going to be a delivery, I think it's the first time Uber Eats was used. Because they weren't willing to leave their bike unattended they demanded I come outside and get it, my partner called me but I missed it, so NO DELIVERY. I've Never had a problem with JUST EAT delivering."
You have to have Facebook to pay cash...not a fan of that
It's good and helpful
Good
The uber eats app one of best app always active always good food good delivery timing it's amazing
"I was told to come down and receive my order. I did exactly that, only to find that the delivery woman was not downstairs and my order was marked as delivered. My money is gone and I still have not receiverd my order even after lodging a complaint with Uber Support. This is unacceptable."
"On the rare occasion the app actually works, the selection of restaurants is depressing, the customer service is abysmal-to-nonexistent, and more often than not your order will be wrong anyway. Better to trek to whatever restaurant you're ordering from than give Uber any money for a service that doesn't work in the first place."
التوصيل غال جدا Disappointed!!!
"Food never came, didnt get refund"
أسوأ برنامج اكل
At first didn't get my order but it was fully refunded.
Best app for food delivery with good promotions .... i liked it a lot ... most of the times 99% offer 😍
"App is buggy and customer support is the worst I've seen. It's not reliable and it will p**s you off! Avoid like the plague, you don't need this."
Very nice
Make things easier n quicker
Could not complete order??your payment method is invalid.please update your billing setting What is this problem
Nice
Supper
Good
Super food
"Pretty great. Not so nice when there's load shedding but overall, I'm pretty happy with Uber Eats. When I've had problems (rarely), everything has been sorted out."
Great and fast service
Péssimo. Você recebe um atendimento ruim e colocam a culpa em você. Nunca mais uso.
Your order depends on the delivery guys' mood so be prepared not getting your food and not being notified for it. Not using and not going to use this app as it happened multiple times. Also I am writing this review second time so maybe they are even deleting the reviews. Call the restaurant or use a trustful app that 100% delivers your food.
Can't lie best food delivery app literally no opponent wish them more succes
Doesn't allow you to pay for items so essentially a wasted app When going to pay for something it keeps saying payment not verified despite it all being ticked and several attempts of different cards and paypal still wont allow us to pay even tried deleting and reinstalling didn't work.
"2 out of 2 orders placed were missing items. On the 2nd occasion I was told there would be no refund (seemingly based on the fact that they couldn't possibly get things wrong so often). Won't be using them again, app deleted."
"Pues bien hasta la semana pasada. No sé aplicaba un código promocional y no quieren reembolsarme. Apparemente, no estoy solo es este caso."
Good service
"My friend didn't get any of their food. ETA was 40min, delivery took 1hr 20min. Food was cold. I requested a partial refund multiple times, but Uber won't refund the missing items unless I buy $100 in Uber credit... Very disappointing"
Had a couple times when I didn't get everything I ordered..but was delivered fast
"Orders are constantly wrong, drivers are almost never who is on the profile, and all the fees are not worth the food. I am uninstalling this app and I will never use this part of Uber again."
Good time
"O app é bom, porem tem entregadores que tentam golpear quando pago no dinheiro"
Lots of variety and deals
I had an order and my order was cancelled and did not receive my refund this is realy poor service
Good experience
Good service
I used the app whilst it was loadshedding. The restaurant accepted the order only to find out 1 hour later our order was never prepared due to the restaurant not having power. I personally think I should have been informed about this when my order was placed instead of waiting for delivery and I was constantly checking the status of the order via the app. Hopefully my next experience is better.
"Great app, very well put together!"
"Worthless. Food never showed. Drivers are useless, and they charged me for the order anyway. Never using again."
Good one
Very poor. No promotion given
Mint saves going out
It was good
Worst app
best online food service pocket friendly
Ncr plz come back
Good
Great Service
"Good app, food yes!"
nice
"Uber is great in regards to deliver your food ,however, they don't take any responsibility for missing items, I had more than 4 missing items till I decided to share my experience, I received a nice message that within 24h ,someone will respond, but unfortunately no response till now. (One month ago) And today it happened again, and no one to talk about it. So Uber this my feedback back to you."
Awesome nice offer good service
"Great deal, very quick, easy to use"
Server error repeatedly immediately after install
Good app
Very nice
I would like to hide vegan/vegetarian restaurants as they do not serve real food
I really have enjoyed my time with Ubwr eats. All I recommended is to get more fast food restaurants. Example chic-fil-a.
Great
Please update the settings of map and locations. Some drivers couldn't find a place properly due to poor track. At the end of the day we are the customers have to listen to their unwanted scolds and stories.
Excellent & love it
"orders get cancelled, not on my part, and refunds are never the full amount.id recommend to just use doordash. also customer service isnt very good, and theres no real way to fix any problems you have with the app."
Ey e e mb
No ridrs
Excellent!
"Really easy to use, absolutely no drama!"
"The food is normally cold upon arrival. The delivery time is often time 30min to an hour later than expected. And if you have a problem with getting your food a hour and a half later than promised, cancel, ( if the option is available) but only to find you'll still be charged for your meal."
Are you guys crazy or what ? How can u let zomato to take over ??? I really liked your app. I want uber eats back.
"When i register to open an account. App says that ""you can't open account your number.. "" Why this happen .can't i use this app?? I forget previous password"
The app isnt working at all. Cant order anything as it says that something is wrong.
Good
Good
حلو
Reliable
The only thing i dont like is that the food isnt as hot as it normally would be if u were to pick it up yourself. Like all uber eat delivery people should have to have a heating take away bag or box so allthe orders stay hot
i got 100 free deliveries. Im a happy man
Good
It's very Bad
Good
Amazing
Good
Very useful app
Easy to use.
User friendly
"Makes food expensive, screws over restuarants with high fees, beyond the terrible they're no different than any other delivery service. Screw uber."
Wow
Perfect
Lekker
Services
"Easy to use, and a smart way to bring your food anywhere you are. I haven't gotten any late delays, the people delivering it, have this great first impression. Absolute genius. Thanks #Ubereats"
Stupid but super
"It's easy to use... I haven't had any problems using the app, or with any drivers. They always arrive on time."
It's a decent app never had any issues with the app itself but I think it's pretty dodgey when promotions expire half way through the day that they're supposed to expire on
Love this app
Very bad service..I paid for the card. The food driver man canceled the food he took from my money and took it home. The company did not respond. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.
"Its a good service, just browsing and finding resteraunts can he a bit tedious"
App Sucks !!!
Have your drivers confirm orders are correct before leaving the restaurant to ensure all items are received upon delivery. Please. And Thank You. ✌🏾 also app is currently down and im hungry.
great app 💪😀
Takes over an hour to get food. And food is long cold by the time you get it
Awesome service best customer experience!
Idk I just love their convenience pf going EVERYWHERE.
How did I place a order and never get it delivered. It has happen 2x to me and uber eats said sorry we cant help you. Man door dash is the place to be they actually have customer service
Nice service
Excellent
Why do you publish the app in Vietnam if youre not operatingin this country? Wasted my time.
"It's super easy to order food from your favourite, local restaurants, the delivery tracking makes it easy to prepare for when your meal arrives and the customer support is efficient and fair. I do however, wish the delivery fees were back to $5 all round because now some places charge up to $8 plus extra fees on top."
My order never showed!!!
"Unable to place order. Kept saying payment method invalid, but ordered successfully the first time."
Its not delivering in my home
Great app
No images of food to display.it would be great if there images with the meal so we can get a idea about the meal.
"Good,"
Won't let me log in Even though the email I use is my only email won't let me do anything 😡
Jk
Not in my area
💙💛🧡💜👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Why u stopped your services. Please break your partner ship with Zomato. We support You.
Good for use
Nice
Ok
Uber cash won't even work
I love uber ...period
Simply love it..
Doesn't download
Horrible always getting orders canceled!
The people who is at Phone Support is the worst thing. They do promises that are not delivered.
Great thanks
I've ordered twice and the app wasn't able to find a driver. So my food was never delivered
Great
Easy to use. The app delivers :)
Placed an order that never arrived and was still charged the entire price of the meal.
ok
50/50 Order fulfillment.
"Used to be a great service, nothing but problems lately. Plenty of other food delivery services to use instead."
Time after time my order is wrong and I'm often not refunded. Thief Thief Thief!
Redeeming a gift card on the app is confusing - it says it was redeemed but I don't see it being added to my order.
Uber eats is a joke! They messed up my order and it was missing half of the order and they wanted to credit me $7 for the fries. We ordered a family meal not just chicken and paid over $50 for it. Your customer service is lacking at best and your delivery service isn't even worth 1 star! Door dash and grub hub are a much better delivery service and take care of their customers!
Easy
Great
"Life saver for university, absolutely love it. Though I don't understand why service charge applies sometimes and other times it doesn't."
There is no special request section. If I want more sauce then I have to call the restaurant and hope they can help.
Orders some times don't arrive. I never received my order and got a message saying thanks for your order and tipping... Whaaaaat..??
"Apparently uber eats , is now on the regylar app. But they never told us. No wonder i have been having problems"
Sometimes it doesnt show any restaurant available unti i reset it for a couple of times
Small order fee is bogus. Might as well just make a $10 minimum
Took too long food cold .
For the second time in a row I haven't received my dessert .
None of my cards Eva work
Would give 0 stars if I could. Constantly cancels orders after waiting forever ruining your meal plans. Doordash and grubhub are miles better than ubereats.
Easy to use and lots to choose from.
Took my money and kept my food.
Uber Eats I love you.
"Terrible app. It's hard enough to order on there, but so many issues with payment methods."
Excellent
I love the app it's Amazon service!
I never get my food delivered on time. Never had a good experience
I should just be able to place an order for any restaurant
Good
Wont open anymore
"Restaurants aren't showing up for me that show up for everyone else, and it is only showing me one ride sharing restaurant while everyone else sees four or five options."
Horrible will never use u again
Love the concept but constantly crashes. Very unreliable. End up ordering dominos whenever this thing crashes while simply browsing for a restaurant. 40% of the time id say
Fees and limited available restaurant choices
Its the best
"So I JUST moved and have absolutely NOTHING in my fridge or freezer order from Ubet eats to have them have delivered it to a completely different address mind you I have a very hungry 5yr old Son whos asking for food to eat call them and have them tell me sorry for your experience i can give u your money back.. NO!! I WANT MY FOOD!! Ive been moving by myself no less, im tired, ive had my 5yr old the WHOLE time riding with me in a uhaul for them to say ill get my money back in 3-5 business days🤬"
Great app
It used to be much better. I've had SO many issues in the past couple months it's rediculous. Yes they refund you but you shouldn't have to do it in the firts place.
Have to wait over 2 hours for a delivery. Because the driver is waiting for another person's order. Is ridiculous.
Faster and safe
Keeps shutting off on me. All i wanna do is order some damn dumplings!!
I will never order uber eats ever again
So far I havent had any bad experices with my food
"Very poor quality and also incorporate customers service center, For second time I made order & changed with fees, than it cancelled with refusing send the order again for restaurant or contact them even. Very bad experience again"
"I WAS wild about this app-- I AM wild about the efficiency of Uber Eats. However, over the past couple of months ur app has given me more trouble than the ""competition's"" apps, and they are horribly run delivery services. Ur app keeps going blank; it just won't load. I get blank pages on the home and cuisine pages, and once it went down when I was in the middle of my placing my order AND I couldn't get the site to load again so, I ordered from Grub Hub!"
Absolutely terrible to deal with when something goes wrong.
good service
"Does not work, and I just tried the regular UBER app to. For some reason neither will let me log in. Only ask for an e mail after providing my cell number, but errors out saying my e mail already exist. Does not provide a log in screen after jnstalling."
Horrible ordered food got it delivered but got someone else's order and wouldn't give me a refund or credit for it will never ever use them again if this is how they treat there customers will stick with just eat and deliveroo as they seem to know how to treat there customers.
Server timed out unable to complete order. First try with the app and it doesn't do jack.
"Couldn't even get it to let me into the actual app. I enter my number and email and it tells me it's already registered, but won't give me any other way to log in. Absolutely ridiculous."
Good food that I have ordered so far after that wait times between it being cooked and delivered
Thank you
well it could be cheaper.
I love it fast and efficient
Works sometimes.
Fast service when needed
Shittest app
Good I love it
Hi mate all is good food was hot good enough
Always good to get food delivered
Uber is great at getting to your door fast. Less hassle than calling a restaurant for delivery. Just a few clicks and 10 minutes later your eating!!
I can't get this app to let me drliver
Had to uninstall it. The previous owner of my current phone number had signed up before and associated my phone number with their email. And uber fails to acknowledge the fact that people do change their phone numbers and emails; thus the app does not let me go forward for registration.
"Le livreur n'a pas appelé, puis est partit avec la nourriture."
I cant even make an order
Everything fine
"Commande jamais reçu. Le livreur n'a jamais appelé, il a attendus une minutes pas loin pour faire genre, et il s'est cassé avec la nourriture. Donc 30€ volés, soirée ruinée, et le service client uber qui ne peut rien faire car le livreur à marqué la commande comme livrée. Au moins le livreur s'est régalé à l'oeil. Pour moi l'aventure uber eats s'arrete là à tout jamais."
Order never arrived and was charged for it. Uber support rang and said I would get a refund. Has been over a month and tried contacting them and nothing has happened.
New update wont let me do anything at all
I get tired of being asked to rare everything after I eat.
Can't talk my card off stupid app
Poor support!
A++
"Do not use this app!!! They are consistently 20 minutes past the quoted latest delivery time, and they delivered someone else's order before mine and still charged me the full delivery fee! I ordered $40 worth of food and when I get it it is cold and soggy. I will never use this service again. There is too much competition from door dash and the like to justify using a second rate app and service like this. Way to loose a customer."
"No support at all, I faced an issues many times, the only thing that they are doing is to provide a dash board if you receive your food late or garbage or even if the driver eat some of it they don't do anything and they don't care. Don't waste you time. (This message after their reply): nothing happened they only throw your compliance to a third team, until you feel bored😒. The last thing they will say its the driver issue (third party) we will make sure that he will never deliver 😑"
"Absolutely appalling customer service. Uber eats are rated 1 star by over 10,000 people on trust pilot and for good reason. The customer service 'help' team are useless, you cannot phone any number to complain and there is no accountability. Absolutely ridiculous, I will be filing a charge back with my bank for the transaction because I got lied to by their call centre staff in order to con me out of money. Ridiculous."
Fast service good value!
Food. Good.
Excellent
Very convenient
Very nice service
"I've never used an app this big that's this consistently bad and buggy. Random crashes, disconnects, and missing notifications plague this thing. Every delivery will visually break at some point along the way, as though your driver got in a crash. Closing the app and reopening it is the only way to check progress, no matter what version you're on. Speaking of versions, updates to the app add ads and bloat instead of bugfixes. Thanks, but I don't care what other people order. Let me order my food"
App not working
i love the fact that i can pay with paypal and that i can track my entire order from preperation all the way till it gets to my door.
Uber Eats has been declining my card on and off when nothing is blocked from my bank. Its so temperamental and I'm disappointed having to install and delete it multiple times before getting it to work.
"Life changer. Wether Im too lazy or can't cook or go out for legitimate reasons, uber eats saves the day!"
"Terrible customer support, and the food too often arrives late and cold due to what appears to be mistakes with the delivery process. Do yourself a favour and use one of their competitors."
"Im so upset. I NEVER leave reviews but today was the worst service Ive had with UberEats. Ive been using uber eats for the past month but TODAY this lady comes and drops off my food (super friendly) but she didnt even realize my order was wrong. I would understand a place forgets 1 item or sauces but right off the back she hands me my drink (wrong size) I come upstair and realize im missing 2 chicken sandwiches, 4 tacos, and small fries. 7 items! What the hell? Not attentive, horrible service"
"Update 2020! They are still the worst. The drivers never double-check the orders, the restaurants never check to make sure they got everything right, and even if they deliver a hot, inedible pile of garbage, you're given the run-around and a $5 credit. The Ubereats service is the worst, customer service is worse than that, and they will straight up steal your money. Use someone, ANYONE else."
Goood
"Absolute trash, half the time my order isnt right, and now it wont even accept my card at all despite it being a debit card with chip tech. Any other delivery is probaly better."
1st time download used worked fine tried a week latter nothing is available for delivery all out of range apparently 1 mile is to far for any delivery this week
The price of the items are about $1 or 2 more than the restaurant and other delivery options. Why?
It won't let me use this app.. says I have opted out for using this. Send text to opt back in but won't send message for me to do this
I ordered a burgers and waited an hour when I got a notification saying that the order had been cancelled I tried calling the Uber driver but I can't because it's been cancelled so I can't track it
This app is great but I couldn't use the free delivery promotion on my phone. It doesnt even exist (btw my phone is Samsung s10). Do u know how I can get the free delivery promotion or else I have to ask my friend to help me order every time which is really annoying. If this can be tackled I would give a 5/5 rate.
Quick efficient and easy to use.
"Why is it that UberEats refuses to assist customers when the restaurant fails us?! Customer service is useless and so is management. They just want to keep your money , even if your food is bad . Terrible experience. I thought we had moved past this level of interaction. Disappointed and dissatisfied."
Don't order from uber eats they are a rip off charged me 15 dollars for food just to be order 2 blocks away. How does that. And it did not say that much for delivery until after i checked my bill and app. Surprise you have been ripped off. 2 times i order at other times the uber driver did not even deliver my food. I call uber eats no one know what happened i guess the driver was hungry i will never use this service again.
Great service. Little to no issues.
Amazing
Did not authorize order
"I ordered extra large meals,,but only recieved the smallest burgers😭😭Im so dissapointed shame."
I can't log in to this app
Had a few times where the order wasn't correct or the promo wasn't applied properly. But otherwise they provide good customer service if this does happen!
Didn't get all of my food or drinks
"Had to search for US phone #. Also, customer service was horrible. I spent $30 on a meal I could not eat as it required utensils as I requested in app. The driver took off and said they would bring my missing items. When I called Uber offered me a $5 credit because it was delivered....AS IF. That's fraudulent- you have to deliver my food for me to know something is missing. Both the restaurant and UberEats were were culpable in my missing items. Customer lost forever"
Delivery was quick and the driver was very polite and food was lovely
"Really Disappointed, there is no time for the customer to Cancel his order. Cancel option just comes for about 2 seconds and disappears, then what's the use of that Cancel Option, and there is no way to Contact Uber Eats Customer Service and Help option in the App is Truly Useless. Please fix this"
"Me encanta, super fácil y rápido de ordenar"
It ok can be confusing at end
Easy to follow and guide.
Pretty useful
"Overpriced menus, poorly designed app, non contactable and inflexible and poor customer service, poor attitude of the staff."
Great delivery
Alright.
Good
"Frequently causing as many headaches as the company solves. I ordered food today, driver was there, restaurant canceled the order. No notification to me, so my kids and I are hungry waiting for food that was not coming. Previously similar evidence except that time driver did not show up to restaurant... uber kept telling new there was just a slight delay. I gave up after 1:30 hours, but then spent another 45 trying to cancel the order to not get charged...."
Its cool!
The app falsely advertises promotion expiry dates. When I brought it up with support they barely bothered to read my complaint and then treated me like an idiot.
Charges 3.50 for delivery and combines with other orders to keep costs low. Yet 3.50 is exoensive and my food is half an hour late still no sign
Nice
Great service everytime. Food arrives on time. People really nice.
I Use it every day
Very good
Comes in handy when I am unable to drive or go out thr grab a bite. Excellent!!
Convenient
Not once been able to make a purchase off this app despite multiple attempts. Keeps telling me my mobile number is not supported even though it says it's verified with a tick in the settings.
"It is a good app except that on some restaurant sites, you are not able to make special requests. For example, the Subway site does not work when asking them to leave off certain items off a sandwich or requesting a certain dressing like spicy brown mustard."
Quick
"Excelente, pero debería haber la opción de escoger el punto de recogida en mapa igual que Uber"
"They mess up your orders on the regular. Vegetarians expect to receive meat multiple times in your ""vegetarian "" orders"
the app is excellent but My order was delayed ...the driver was great 💯
Ya'll help me a lot
Havent been able to complete an order for 5 days and even though i have contacted uber eats I have had no reply regarding getting the problem fixed!!
Great for my work lunches no issues
"It's not downloading, I tried it many times"
"i order by uber first time from mc donalds, someone bite my burger its discusting expirience. no trust at all next time."
"Easy and good service most of the time. Would be cool if the menu options were the same as the restaurant options and have more ways to order to personal liking, and or on the side .. I.e options to order 1/2 n 1/2 on the side or ice water . Sometime its not easy to report issues on order ! Thank you !"
Good
Easy and quick to use.
The best food delivery app
Super
The app is giving difficulties when one needs to verify the last step every time it rejects the Facebook verification or the card verification won't work or will send you an error message .... All the the time ... For me this app is very useless
Can't continue without giving my phone number. Can't even see if there is anything in my area. Uninstalled without ever finding out. I'll give my number if I need to place an order and not just to open the app.
Stop making us pick restaurants across town
نصااابين
Very easy and very convenient...
hh
Earlier use to work with mixed experience but now message is received that it has been acquired by Zomato and further does not work.
Delivering to our home has at most times been a disappointment. At most times the drivers never end up deliveing our order and such the order is cancelled.
Highly recommended!
I'd give a half star if I could this is the 2nd time I've ordered from uber eats and it said 30-40 mins for delivery and it's taken 2 hours and the food was cold! I will never use it again and wont recommend it to anyone. I'm extremely dissatisfied and unhappy!!!
Horrible service my food came cold and it was disgusting and the delivery driver had his wife in the car with hem because I had a dog he was scared to come out of the car and walk to the door of my budling to give me my food I had to wave at hem so he would finally get out of the car and give me my food which was disgusting and I contacted Uber eats they only gave me 5 dollar credit instead of full refund horrible service
Idk what the issue is but I could be a mile away from where I want delivery from and it tells me it's out of range. I am not allowed to leave my place of employment and Uber eats is really all I have. This is getting old and it needs fixed
I just wish that we had more options in Columbus IN. But awesome service
They are very rude. They justify serving you cold food instead of hot and take the money without even a gesture. I am fed ip with ubereats. They keep on changing time of deliveries and bad customer service. Going to the others now. Enough is enough. Spent way too much money with their bad attitude.
"I like the app. I do find the various fees too much , service fee, delivery fee and then you have to tip."
Gr8
Ok
"2nd time one of their driver's stole my food, I'll never order with uber again!"
Extremeply poor service and attitude towards the consumer.
nice and convenient
its awesome they communicate well and their prices are reasonable
This was my first time using Uber eats delivery and I'm very pleased with the service thank you so much!!
App is terrible let's me order food when there is no one to deliver it
Great app it makes lifes easy.
App rarely works well :( No way to contact support right away.
O wiele dłużej zajmuje zamówienie czegoś przez tę apke niż przez inne tego typu. Zdjęcia są stockowe i nie pokazują jak jedzenie wygląda i tylko powoduje to frustracje. Chcesz skorzystać ze specjalnej promki? Cóż często wyskakuje powiadomienie że nie możesz jej użyć mimo że jest jeszcze ważna i wszystko się zgadza i tak zamiast zamówić coś w 5 minut i czekać na dostawę męczysz się pół godziny aż w końcu jej nie odinstalujesz i nie zamówisz przez pyszne.pl
"Occupies lost of storage, inconvenience app"
We will order again I hope to be amazing
"Really good, way better than just eat!"
"Used to work really well. I use uber to order mcdonalds all the time. Now it's always saying that every restaurant I used to order from now can't be ordered from? Then 5 minutes later it says mcdonalds can now deliver. Then 10 minutes later its unavailable again? It's really aggravating. I go to order a ton of food for my friend and family and am willing to spend a ton of money only for it to suddenly say that its unavailable??? Can you fix this? Also, a lot of promotions don't work."
Easy and simple and good informative menu choice.
Sorry but this app is acquired by zomoto . My account is not open .so this is very sad for me
Please deliver hot. but food delivered always cold. Give your drivers bag so food stay warm. Thanks
On time
"Used it twice, got both orders wrong from 2 different places"
Very good 👍
Good Happy Eats
Too many damn fees.
Great app
It asks me to order from Zomato. Remove this from Google Play store.
Most places got it but there's moments they forget things. I get refunds here and there.
They shouldn't allow you to order food if they have no driver's I've been waiting 2 hours for my food and cant cancel because I may not get a refund
Super
Perfect fast efficient
"Update 8/3/2020 - The whole order was wrong and the refund I got was less than 3£ what an absolute joke. Even my first ever order was late, what a bunch of clowns. How about you implement some standarts in this so called ""business""."
I register with my cellphone number says my password is not exist .like really
Have used this app a few time and it has just got worse and worse. Food last night could not even eat was awful and the driver called so many times as he said he could not find our house food was cold by the time he got to us. Made a complaint and was given £2 credit on my uber account which I won't use as won't be using this again. Shocking customer service.
The uber app keeps taking them to the wong place so when the food gets to me its cold and i have had drivers who have refused that there in the wong place leading to orders been cancelled even know i send i megs saying the app takes you to the wong place and wherevi am
There are to many charges not worth ordering when you have to pay three times the price for simply fast food. I say this because I wanted to order breakfast it came to $8.70 and I was being charged an extra two dollar's because it wasn't over $30 plus I still had tax and delivery to pay then to top it of if you want to cancel an order because it would take to long you are charged to cancel uber eats is garbage just another way to gouge people's hard earned money
"Again no donut delivery, and almost every choice included McDonald's lol"
The was best phone call i ever made with a service.very friendly thanks
"Food was warm, but was delivered very late, I live just couple blocks away, I can not drive, to the restaurant. becouse. I became disable, the driver David, he had great attitude and excellent costermer service. I order food, last night 830pmor, and ,did not receive my order, or comfirmatiom, it was my first time ordering."
Their app sends drivers to the wrong apartment even though my address is correct and I have instructions for how to get there. Seems to be routing based on my gps location only.
Very expensive delivery fees. Not worth it.
I love you
Has anyone ever been able to order McDonald's from this app? It's unavailable 364 days a year
App keeps crashing and their support is rubbish all what they do is contact you with generic emails.
Worse app
"Very bad, it takes previous order location when we put new order then app will charge from us for wrong location. App should get current location from the Google map or asking from us"
"All good when things go well, total scam when they don't I ordered lunch for two people. Two full menus, burgers, side dishes, drinks, the works. After 1 hour the food gets here and it's only 1 menu! I try to contact uber eats about this, there is no way to get in direct contact with them (phone, chat), you can only leave them a message to which they will reply ""in max 24 hours"". Been using uber eats for years but if this is how they treat their customers I'm uninstalling the app now, bye!"
I would give no stars to this company. Twice I have had an issue with food and never that any response back from uber. My advice is stick with Deliveroo.
جيد
Good
Scanning card don't work so couldn't order
Perfect
User friendly & very reliable!
"May new number used by someone, but when I reset my pswd to new signup, there no option, fail app design. When not give to any food order"
Doesnt properly send text
Food came very undercooked. They wouldn't approve a refund even after the restaurant said they'd refund me. Uninstalled and cancelled my pass. Their customer service really doesn't care about anything but making money. Whether the food is edible or not. Good riddance. I'll use another app from now on. Always a problem with this app. Always. It's more of an inconvenience ordering breakfast when you can't leave the house from a kid being asleep early in the morning. It's late or inedible.
Very bad experience!
Please remove this app if service not available
Order was deleyed 4 times and never delivered. Disappointing.
Punctual
Deliver is the worse
The help below does not help. Not a valid address to send a note!! No option to purchase an EatsPass in the app (with the latest version). They say the only option is to purchase through the app; and zero help with resolving this. Terrible customer service to resolve. Guess they don't want my money. I want to buy a Pass!
Very convenient
Suruta loss
good
Yho🚮
Tried ordering indian food through this app. The order was immediately canceled but the money was still taken from my account. Now I am trying to get my money back through their helpdesk. It's been two days now waiting for a response. Never ordering through this app again.
"The app is completely broken, it's been already mentioned by others, but the address and card functions aren't working."
Excellent
I ordered my food an hour ago!!! Now my order is canceled. I hope I'm not charged because of them not being able to deliver...literally.
Very easy
Frustrating
great servive
Super
"Требует какой-то пароль (что?). Чтобы его сбросить, требует эл.почту (зачем?). Мой адрес почты не принимает. Идиотизм."
I received an email offering 15euros for my first order. I ended up paying the full amount without any reduction. There was no way to apply the reduction during the order and once the order placed no way to cancel it. I find it a cheap way to trick people to use the application.
This is own by zomato. Wasted my 30MB data and 2 minutes time. You should directly redirect to zomato instead of showing the same in app. Wasting of time
"Their service can be very good. I have managed restaurant to mouth within 9 minutes before. However, they won't accept any responsibility for the service they provide. You may have a delivery driver admit they don't know there area, as I did, then get lost, then arrive with the ice cold drinks next to the hot food inside the insulated bag. My food couldn't be resuscitated. Just be wary, they won't refund, won't accept any responsibility and will reply with automated messages/templates."
"Terrible ,will never use again"
Cool
Thanks for adding a time limit to cancel after the order.
When it works it's the perfect drive thru without leaving the sofa! Thank you Jesus. When it doesn't its because there's no drivers or there's a system error (which means they have no drivers). Completely miss breakfast sessions and it's just not reliable.
Driver cancelled my order and stole my food. Now I have to get a refund. If there willing to steal food I can't imagine how much food they will eat on its way to me. I won't use this app anymore
Good app and fast delevring
zomato hi download karale ne..jb kharid liye hoto😑😑😑
Very good app
ممتاز
Excellent
I waited three hours just to have to call uber to find out that my order was not coming. What a big waste of time.
Missing Uber Eats in INDIA😢
This application was very bad
Such a useful app
Excellent app
"The same service,deals and promotions that they offer should also be offered. Conveniently You offer the satisfaction of a service that offers satisfaction of being convenient to there customers,why offer us the a service if not get same service u are used to.if there a saving, ur obligated to rush before the time runs out and have to order more to get that saving offered. realizing u end up not really saving. notice didnt even cover the service fees. 3 different fees depending order."
"The worst app ever, all of these people are frauds, applied promotion but didn't apply"
"More free vouchers would be good, it's quiet, expensive"
Best app ❤️❤️❤️🇦🇪
got a paper through my letterbox saying it delivered to my area now got on the app and it says it hasn't reached me yet ?
"great app, great service, food delivery made easy. I wish staff were treated better, but it's opt in so i guess you weigh the good with the bad."
"If i could I would like to give zero stars... I tried this app twice. First time was when it just started. They did not deliver in Pretoria, so I deleted the app. Now i downloaded it again, but I cannot get past the email address as it says it's already in use by someone else - dughhh, was me years ago, obviously. But there is no way going further from there. Deleted the app again. I won't be trying it again"
According to the app the service isn't in my area which is bull. My friend ordered from the app (in the same area) with no problems yet I can't? Everytime I visit a mcdonalds there's an UberEats delivery person in the store picking up orders so I know they're obviously operating in the area.
"Orders are generally not as advertised, recently vehicles don't show on map. Seema it has gone down quality."
Grate service
Good service!
"On 07/03/2020 I booked a ride to railway station. After confirmation I called the driver to share his location. He said, he is 800m away. It will take 5mints to reach. After 10 mints I called he again, this time he said previous passenger is unloading. In hindi, it is like ""saman utarega tab na aaunga"". He was very rude and arrogant. After that I waited for 30mints but he didn't showed up. I got call from driver after 60mints that he reached the pickup point. How can any1 rely on UBER if..."
Good
Prices on Uber Eats or as a matter of fact in all food delivery apps are significantly inflated as compared to the price on restaurant's menu and on top of it they charge delivery fees. Looting public.
Hahahahaha hate this. They aren't even accurate with timing of food vendors and I pay waaaaay too much in service and delivery fees. Do yourself a favor and go get it yourself or call the place directly.
Never again will I use this app. First and last time. Food spilled I called the driver back but her walked off as if he didn't hear me. I could not contact the restaurant and when I finally did they acted like they had not sent any food to my address. My order was incomplete. What was not spilled did not taste very nice at all. I'd give zero stars if I could.
Garbage company. Getting rid of app.
We want uber eats
"Worst food delivery app ever, charging me for food order that was canceled. Called the support centre and no help was given besides a bunch of technical explanations."
Needs to give a warning before store you're ordering from closes; tried to order 3 times on a Sunday only for the stores to close while I decided in 15 mins max each
"Food was good, delivered right on time!!"
I don't have DEBIT and credit card how can i book my order here payment showing only Card. i can pay cash. Plz help me.
good
Not satisfy bcoz many problem here to second time login . ☹☹☹
Nice
I did not apply the account before but I think there's previous user using the exact same phone number now I can't even apply it
Useless app
good
Excellent service
Payment works 10% of the time
"Customer service is absolutely zero. Impossible to find a phone number to call when something goes wrong and the one that is buried in their help articles has a 'optus advises that this phone has been disconnected"". Very dodgy! Very frustrating!"
Doesn't work half the time
App is fine. BUT YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE NOT HELPFUL. I AM SO DISPOINTED WITH THIS KIND OF SUPPORT. I WILL RATE YOU 0 FOR THAT.
NOT ACCOUNT LOGIN PLEASE DONT INSTALL THIS FAKE APP
Great app!
Pathetic doesn't want your comments if there is nothing negative and honest they force you to say you liked everything the Uber eats and that the restaurant you chose from is and was good even if it's burnt or cold they don't care they want lies I'm hoping they'll Post this but I doubt it because it's the second time that I'm trying to post this
Great service
Wonderful food was on time
Lack of in-app tech support
Worked flawlessly
App does not work. Stuck on enter address screen and will not search for an address
Love it
Nice good
Everything is overpriced
Nice
Love it
"I used the app for the 1st time and not only did i have to wait 2 hrs for my food but then when my phone finally dinged it was not an indication that my food had arrived, nope, it was an notification that after all that waiting my driver had canceled my order. I kept updating the app & Samuels' location never left the street where the restaurant is located. My apartment is at the front of the building & no one ever walked up & he never called. It's now to late to reorder. Back to doordash i go."
Its good and reliable but the only problem is that it takes a lot of time hope youl fix that problem.Be grateful I gave you 3 stars
"Fast, easy and fun to use."
"en veces esta perfecta, en veces esta culera"
Always a great service
There some dirty fuilty restaurants in uber eats please add a option to see the original restaurant they add fake pictures please dont let this kind of restaurants in uber eats this can cuase serious food safety issues for the people that use uber eats
Awesome
Very good every one should get it
We really miss you Uber eats we can't order from another app because the price of food cost is to hight and delivery charge and tax is to high in swiggy and zomato we really miss you come back soon ........ please......
I was charged $9.99 for a eat pass i was not aware of nor authorized im trying to contact to get that refunded but it looks like they won't give a refund for something i never agreed to or had knowledge about so they will charge you for stuff and not tell you about it then tell you oh we cant refund the eats pass you never authorized this is why i moved to door dash... i was told they will not refund the unauthorized charge to my card

Quick n fast food love ehttt
So far it is amazing
Bad designed app. It seems like you're adding items to your order but in reality you are removing them. I ended up paying $18 for a ramen with just noodles and broth.
Wrong order - got less than half my refund. Food insanely overpriced
"Waited an hour and a half! Food was never delivered, and the app said it was, there is no way of getting in contact with customer service. After waiting 1.5 hrs, I want more than a refund! This is insane!!!!"
Poor experience. Used to be great but not Uber is constantly a disappointment.
"Good app but it sometimes confirms orders while im still adding onto the order, really annoying but it is an ok app"
Very good
"Lately I have been unable to order, period. Scroll through, select a restaurant, make up my order, click check out, and boom ""Server Error Order location is too far from store"" nothing is more aggravating than getting home from work putting an order in and getting stopped right before paying and being told ""you can't have that"" picking something else from somewhere else ""nope"" rinse and repeat until you give up. It's utterly ridiculous I have to play guessing games depending how the app feels rn"
"Nunca acepta el método de pago, pésima aplicación"
Good substitute of a choice
"Perfection, so much time saved when you have a kid."
The free delivery promotion is always the same restuatants now. They use to change every 5 minutes.
Always nice and easy to order. Great deals on occasion
"I quit using Uber because of their greedyness. They pad the prices, then nail on a service fee, then tack on a delivery fee... then pad the tax. 25.00 order ends up costing you 45.00 after tip. Too much! Doordash is cheaper!"
"I had it for some time, but recently I ran into a problem where I ordered a meal a while back. I did this on Nov 18. I then get my regular uber account stopped since uber eats advice them I did not make the payment and was declined by my bank. Though my bank had nothing to do with it. It was a charge that was process through my PayPal. At one point I called the 1800 number they had on their account. Got transferred like 5 or 6 times. Only to be told the same damn thing. Dont use this app"
Great foods. Always on time.
Keeps bringing drivers to the wrong address.
The tracking is great! Easy to use.
"Nice and easy, exspecially on the long days."
"Broken navigation system. Always leads drivers to incorrect location and we have to chase each other down. I am one starring because I have raised this concern countless times to no avail. Either choose a better approximate location such as the likes of DoorDash and GrubHub or allow us to use a location pointer similar to the regular Uber app. Don't get me wrong, I love Uber Eats and was a regular customer, but I am finally fed up of this chasing game. Won't be coming back till this gets fixed."
IT doesnt ley me pay
Wish prices were better
You have our address wrong. We've asked it to be fixed many times.
Excellent but a little pricey
The app is still convenient but now it's difficult to order because it won't load up until you sign out and sign in and then it starts loading up again I hope this gets fixed soon because I do enjoy this app
"Theres no customer care at all. Can not trust to add account details. Please careful. I have send more than 15 , E mails but i got only automated reply. When call the Hotline they said "" we can do nothing here you have to follow the E mails.)"
Poopy
"Everything says ""Location too Far"" even stuff 1mile away."
Great experience every time! Best delivery app by far. Worth the extra $1-2
Love it
Simply does not work. Cannot add card. Cannot use gc countless unknown errors
Fits my lifestyle perfectly
We have been waiting almost a year for Uber Eats to deliver to our house! The cutoff is still 5-6 houses away in our subdivision. They still won't open delivery to the rest of the subdivision after a year.
It works
"Nunca cunpre o horario que eles mesmo determinam, o serviço uber eats está cada vez pior!"
As expected. No surprises. You order food. You get the food. Everyone wins
"a good 60% of the time either the driver or the restaurant cancels and I'm left with a charge on my card for the better part of a week, don't bother"
Addictively amazing
App interface excellent. However restaurants always leave off lytle things like utensils sauces drinks etc
Pleasant delivery person. Prompt
Fast
I like it
Its awesome
Everyone Cancels screw this app total waste of time
"estou há uma hora tentando entrar no aplicativo após reinstalar e nada, o que aparece é ""não estamos disponíveis no momento"". uma situação bem chata que já aconteceu outras vezes."
"Both times ordered food was missing, calles them & they said a credit then disabled my sct. I think there still butthurt from me auitting on them as they allow people to ise address else where then text you to deliver some where else. Awful! Report to Better Business Beaurs"
"Uber Eats has been acquired by Zomato. Once you install this app, they'll redirect you to Zomato. So it's better to install Zomato instead of Uber Eats."
"The app works well. My disappointment lies in the fact that there is a service fee on top of a delivery fee. Couple those with taxes and a tip and I am essentially paying for another meal. As if those concerns weren't alarming, by the time I order my meal, the delivery time is almost an hour if not an hour. So, I've now paid in fees for an extra meal and the original order I've placed is delivered to me an hour later and cold or dry. (chicken, etc.) There's no discount for returning customers."
Uber eats is quite literally the best app on any device. 🔥🔥🔥
Trash
It's a good system but if you have problems with an order (for example a missing items) all you can do is send a support ticket. There's no number to call or no one to instant message which is quite concerning. I got a response hours later which is not good enough so I will stick with deliveroo
Awesome for them lazy nights when you just wanna chill😎
Easy app no problems
"Delivery fee amount changes from user to user. Even if we order to the same restaurant, at the same time for the same meal and from the same place."
Got any coupons? 😃
"Price gouging at its finest. $1 menu items are $3+ from McD. These guys are not only charging deliver fees, but they're also double to triple charging on food."
"Update: Despite Uber's misleading reply to this review, my issue was NOT resolved. Took $20 because they didn't let me put in an delivery address, used the wrong one and wouldn't let me correct it. The support staff refused to fix it and just told me I was getting charged anyway and to just get it right ""when [I] order again."" Uber steals your driver's tips. Uber steals your money. Uber never fixes their broken app."
Excellent service!
"ABSOLUTE SCAM!! My order kept getting pushed back which was irritating to start. Then when I tried to cancel my order, it told me I had to pay $24! There wasn't anyone who had picked the order up and it still said the restaurant was preparing the order. DO NOT USE THIS APP!"
"Wow. The incompetence of support staff is beyond joke. They don't even read my request they just come back to me with random, unrelated things to do. Just wow."
"Doesnt let me log in, keeps telling me my own email isnt mine"
Food was almost an hour late.
Damaged inedible order & app will not allow tip to be changed. A $50 ripoff.
Amazing
Great I love it
"Love it. I've delivered and worked for uber eats. Both things are great. It's very convenient, easy to use, and is still broadening our restaurant options."
Not that intuitive. Frustrating. No phone service. Too many cancelled orders. Screens that don't scroll.
"Great experience Everytime. Fast , friendly service."
They're always forgetting items... should be easier to not have cheese on my order since in allergic
Please start this service at Gazipur Chowrasta
Good job
"Driver complaining that we should have order directly from the store, he had to wait a half hour for the for as if it was our fault. I had to wait well over a hour for delivery."
Don't use. Just had an order canceled because I didn't speak Spanish when the driver contacted me. Not using their service again.
My first time using this app and so far I like using this 🔥
Rubbish
Makes dinner easy!!
They over charged me when I didn't order anything and also forgot to give me a drink not happy with them :-(
Easy to use!!!
I want to open a account on uber eats not as a customer but i want to work in uber eats anyone who can help me do it i live in London
Excellent
"The extra charge doesn't make sense. Seamless doesn't charge 15% extra on top of the order, not sure why Uber eats does"
"Terrible. Been trying to place an order for an hour and I just keep getting an internal server error. When it does work, it takes longer than any other delivery service to get food."
"Used to love this app but it has not been working for months. Keeps asking me to put in my address and won't move beyond that page. I've updated it multiple times, uninstalled it, reinstalled it. Nothing."
Me gusta
A $14.65 service fee!!!!!!!! That's outrageous!! Dinner would have been over $130.
Good for a first timer. Thanks.
Nice and easy
It's ok
"I've placed an order and only got delivered half of it... Complained and they have refunded me straight away, applaud them for that, but the thing is, i didnt get everything delivered and i told them i would rather have the rest delivered instead of tge refund which they completely ignored... I'm not happy with this app and won't use it again"
The Customer service did not care to take my feedback. so I'll just type it here Not only the application have a very limited number of restaurants ( 2-3 ) but also it took literally 2 hours or more ( still ongoing ) to deliver an order I hate the second I ever thought of downloading and using such an awful app. I'd advise canceling the service in Egypt before it destroys what Uber app reputation
Great drivers and usually on time!
No good app. I have had the app crash on me sticking during search. Last update may have helped some . App has stopped before delivery where you can't change payments. You cant turn off uber cash. All the charges that makes your credit card stop working after a few orders in a day. Best thing bought the app was the response from developer.This app does not let you cancel food or change addressees and does wierd stuff like change my address..
Good
"For the most part the app works great, but more and more frequently it's been bugging out, with saying places I've ordered from tons of times are too far, or that a restaurant that was available when I selected it is no longer available when I go to check out. I've also had communication errors where I ordered something and the driver doesnt have it on his order check list. They are quick to give you a refund if something is missing or wrong, and generally very helpful."
"ladrones, no me han reembolsado dinero, por un pedido malo, y el menú de ayuda no responden nada, no sirve"
Delivery partners are great but the customer service from uber itself is horrible. No communication when an error is made and no option to call. Menulog is far better.
Can't set the exact location of my apt it just let me select the neighborhood name but the location for the delivery guy always shows in the middle of the area. Also payment method switches randomly I never use cash and last time out of nowhere I was being asked to pay in cash. For the amount of presence that Uber has in the world it's a shame the app has those type of bugs that can be easily fixed by a good developer.
"Update: my account got banned soon after posting my original review. Original: Very bad! I can't even order! Like I tried all of my cards and none of them passes your verification. I even tried PayPal. I contacted your support team multiple times, and I have never gotten a reply."
I really like ordering here.
App is great but like 50% of restaurants don't listen to notes like sauce options
Awesome experience!
First time order all is excellent. Very good and very pleased
Never had a problem with this app. Very helpful if the restaurant messes the order up too
Never using this app again cant call for customer service in the app and they allow their drivers to pick up more than one order at a time so your food is always late very disappointed with this service
They charges me for the Uber pass and I can't place an order say
I have been waiting for an order that should have only taken 30-45 min for over 2 hours now. I can't cancel my oder because the driver got there in the right time span. I can't contact the driver because no contact information is available. I don't really know what to do and the app offers 0 helpful advice. I am honestly thinking this is the last time I use this app before uninstalling it.
I have more than 1 hour trying place an order and i cant
How does it let you place an order when there are no driver's to deliver it
"Waste of time, dont even deliver to my adress"
"I ordered food and it was delivered in a reasonable time. I received my food and tipped the delivery person 3 dollars, the 3 dollars that I tipped was then charged to my card. There was a charge for the food and also a separate charge for the 3 dollar tip. Why? Should I not tip at the door? I will never use uber eats again."
Better than doordash
"I received and uber eats gift card so I decided to install. Not only could I not apply the gift card credit to my order but now it's nowhere to be found. I followed the instructions to tap the button above place order all that comes up is venmo, credit/debit, or PayPal."
"Absolute disgrace of a service. Take my money instantly, but take two week to give it back when your driver can't follow the SIMPLE delivery instructions and cancels the order with no attempt to make contact. Shame, Uber. Shame!"
Too expensive
Every other order is missing something. Had a bad experience and will refrain from this company now
Uber is a absolute disgrace. 2 days in a row mcdonalds did not deliver my food. I was refunded on the first delivery but on the secound in which my kids food was not delivered the told me i was a liar. The customer service is a joke. I am very disappointed. Please only use this app if you like being mistreated. Should be ashamed of there selves.
1st time ever using this & my order was missing my items! I cant even get a refund tried calling I'm getting a whole run around
Terrible app
Need faster delivery please.
"CUPOUN ""eats-5yq0c5"" for a 10€ discount it is a great app just sometimes the restaurants don't put a good description of the plate so I recommend looking for the menu online."
Not as convenient. Most of the time drivers never have change. Then you have to some how go hustle from neighbors for cash change
Very nice
"Used to work great, but now when I open it, it tells me to enter a new address and time.. but it doesn't go anywhere. If there was an update recently, it broke the app. Literally can't do anything."
"Easy to use. Love it. Service fees can be high, but some places have free delivery on the delivery fee, so that helps...it's not many places with free delivery, but I found a few I enjoyed."
"Always saying my number is invalid despite being a legit number. And when I contact support, they could not help me at all. Uninstalled because whenever I order it asks for a number WHICH I CANNOT ADD. Update: I can order again without going to that update number now. Thank you."
Terrible app. Bad drivers. Steal food. Disgraceful customer service
"Poor service. App is fine, but delivery is so slow and drivers drop collections at the last minute. I'll be using Just Eat from now on."
Great app. Only thing they need to fix is also allowing the buyer to say if they have received their food. Cause I had a good 1st time experience but the poor guy forgot to notify Uber eats that he delivered... And I can't too.
I made multiple orders by mistake. I wanted to cancel the wrong orders but couldn't do it because the app is say6yiu don't have the latest app for a live chat. I am deeply disappointed
Everything is working again. I guess it just spazzed out for a bit. Thanks for your help.
"I got hacked 5 times within 48 hours and Uber Eats did absolutely nothing to help me. I contacted the support & provided them with all the information they claimed I needed. They suggested it might be one of my family members, but I told them that I was the only one with access and it was clear it was not me ordering since the orders were all within short times spans in Florida, California, Texas, Illinois and New York. They never got back to me afterwards. Never using Uber or Uber Eats again."
"Stuck on address search. Uninstalled and reinstalled, no joy. Keeps telling me that there is an error in the address search. Finally uninstalled for good."
"Be careful, the prices not true. Uber eats double the menu prices on you plus delv fee انتبهوا الاسعار غير حقيقية، تم تدبيلها عن المنيو الخاص بالمطعم ،، هذا غير قيمة التوصيل وكل التوصيل نفس الطريقة"
By far the most robust delivery platform. The UI/UX is just right so it's easy to use. And prices are not bad at all especially if you sign up for Eats Pass .
The route showed by the gps is not accurate when the delivery is at private neighborhood.
Great service when you're in a pinch for lunch
When they say im in range it works fine.
The app itself is well done but the service is appalling. Long delays cold food and zero feedback when you ask about it. I had heard a lot of horror stories about Uber eats and it's absolutely true. Terrible delivery service
Uber eats is very fast and food is delivered hot
Absolute joke
I had been using this app frequently. Always had an item missing like a whole drink. The last time I will ever order from them the driver marked my order delivered and didnt actually deliver it. When I called uber eats they didn't believe me and I spent an hour on the phone trying to get my food or my money back
"AT 1ST THEY WERE GREAT, BUT THEN AFTER AWHILE MY FOOD IS ALWAYS MISSING. AND WHEN YOUR ORDERING FOR GUEST OR FRIENDS ITS SO EMBRASSING. LOVE UBER DRIVE BUT NOT EATS."
Not bad I prefer just eat.
Good
I'm still waiting for my food to be delivered so I am giving you one star no one has knocked on my front door and I am getting really mad
Food takes forever to receive! & after more than hour food is delivered cold & uber eats never refund for the trash of food
Great service.
At the beginning it was cool but later on I get alot of missing items bad food and delivery super late!
"I enjoy the convenience and the large amount of options. I was injured so I used this app more often during that period, and the service was reliable, quick, and professional. The drivers were almost always punctual and friendly. However, the service fee is a ridiculous way to charge two delivery fees. It's unreasonable. Also, I can't remove any payment method I add, so by now I have a long list of card numbers, some of them even expired and there is no place to ask for technical assistance."
Poor support on the part of the company even for Gold Members. Not the most economical delivery service but always counted on the UE brand. But these things happen. Prefer to support local delivery services. Thank you.
Doesn't work and freezes
Love being able to order from the comfort of my sofa and count on it to arrive within an hour.
The worst exprience in my whole entire life. !!!!! This is an update I just received an email that i'm supposed to pay the amount of the order that i requested to cancel 5 hours ago !!! You have a call recorded between me and Ahmed a representative that i stayed with on hold waiting anf requesting several times to contact a manager !! And several emails and u asked me to call the Restaurant which I DID and they told me they'll try to cancel it And i called the driver and i have recorded calls
🤯
Great fast helpful
I cannot seem to find chicken licken on the app which is so frustrating. I live in Wendywood and cannot pick up anything. Please help!
Doesn't take prepaid cards
"Easy to use, shows more information than other apps, simple to use, and the app is complete. Go for it!"
Goodgugalimoogall
Great app!! Easy to use and great to see on the map where the driver is! 😁
Terrible if you have to deal with customer service. Also dont expect to get what you order and pay for. But do expect to be ignored.
Very sick of getting to my order and then it telling me I live too far away even though I've ordered from their a number of times before.
"It's been ok but sometimes Uber shutdown other restaurants I like in order for other restaurants to get business and that's not right. I am using this because I am in tijuana, mexico and I do not want to risk making contact with those who are infected with flu like symptoms."
Terrible. Late every time!
My first order was PERFECT I am really Impressed.
Won't let me delete account. No one ever contacts back for issues. And send people to the wrong address even though my address is put in. Also won't let me update my phone number
Can't sign in
I love uber eats
"Super prático e preciso, até mesmo na entrega informando quem irá entregar e a placa do veículo para maior segurança."
Very useful and easy to use
"Pricey, but great"
fast accurate thank you
I'm always missing something food cold
App takes to long to Download
They need better competent people to deliver food.
Nice fast delivery
"Still cant get to order food , passwords all wrong"
I love this app perfect for when you have cravings but you don't want to drive anywhere for them.
It works!
"Somehow a disappointing app gets worse, not only is delivery only 50% of time happening but then support decides to disconnect while I'm writing to them. I wish 0 was an option"
Khatam app h sala open hi nhi hora bc
"If you rate 4 stars or less, you will be constantly asked to change the rating presumably for 5 stars. That alone justifies a 4 star (or lower) rating."
Can't see first $30 free meal promo working.
Always on time
"Yes, the app is super clean and usable in design. But how about adding an option to call support if needed? I am unable to find a single option for contacting customer service. All are FAQs and my issue isn't listed. What am I supposed to do? And how is there no option to contact the restaurant from the order status screen? Or give me more details about my already placed order (payment method, address.). I'm enjoying the service so much, but the app seems to be missing MAJOR features for me."
Always helpful
Not able to login with my phone number as it shows no password
Worst app booking not available need to install other app
"Only problem I have is submitting an issue with an order. If my order is messed up, it's a hassle to get a refund for it or anything."
Love it
This app has been bad from the beginning I have uber credit and cant even use it. Keep saying server error and I need to update me billing info which I did multiple times using different cards which I shouldn't have too cause I have credit. But cant order nothing so I just have credit that I cant even use
"App is good, I have order from KFC. Very poor service from KFC. Very bad becoz of the KFC wattala I am uninstall the ubereates app"
Limited restaurants. Not enough choicesvin my area
Good
Muy buena experiencia
I rated this app and somehow they deleted my rating. They keep sending me 1 time special offers limited time only but we dont have uber in my area so now I'm just missing out and will never be offered that same deal again. I deleted and unsubscribed.
"They don't do there due diligence to ensure every restaurant, as well as, food delevery person is up to par. They're an internet company who developed an amazing app. But at the end of the day you need a human being to interview/vet, each employee... When you take on this responsibilityand Mcdonalds screws up an order, it's no longer Mcdonalds fault, it's uber eats fault."
I canceled an order last week and I never received my refund. I was told that if an order is canceled before it is processed then I will get a FULL refund but I received nothing. This is unacceptable. $19.55 was taken out of my back account and I bought not received any food.
Nothing ever worked when trying to order with Uber
Uber eats pass is not beneficial you get free delivery but are taxed on delivery fees including their service charge so it works out the same!
Excellent but updated version is coming to better
Our yesterday driver we paid him for the meals and he didn't checkout and now uber eats says we have an outstanding payment while we paid him
Horrible unprofessional customer service
Never got my refund its been like 7 days
Nice driver....
"Orders takes so long more than 2 hours for the last order, and they pick it from the far pranch while I have one 5 minutes from my house"
Poor service beware app crashed and ordered twice in error. Uber would not cancel or refund order cost me over £72! Still in dispute with them even though I sent duplicate order back. Dont order with them!!
Awesome
I cant order i dont know how
They allow restuarant to feed u anything undercooked food and you're better off making a sandwich at home
Good
This app is great
Useless! Didnt even get as far as placing an order. Couldnt get past location😡
Not easy way to retrieve user password only by email and not with mobile number with otp
Awsome
"I've always gotten my food, unlike door dash where I've ordered three different times and never gotten my food."
Nice
"I ordered some food that never arrived and was reported as delivered. I got in contact with uber using the help center and the only response i got was ""to confirm if the order was delivered"". I replied and never heard from uber again. A disgusting custumer service and I guess I will never see my money again... Never using ubereats again!"
Ok
"After ordering once my app no longer shows the restaurants, it just goes to the map and says they are not where you are yet, how do I fix this?"
For some reason my order was placed in Tallahassee. When the box with my address was clearly marked. I didn't realize it was 4hours away until the driver map popped up. So now I'm out 40$ and the driver got breakfast on me. The Uber eats office just told me tuff luck. I will never use them again.
Good could be faster
"Amateurs Ordered food that I was charged for that never arrived I've tried to contact uber eats numerous times but have never got a reply this is absolutely disgusting, I shall be seeking legal advice to get my money back . This is disgusting they are absolute amateurs!"
Easy
"Enjoy the app, but the food is kinda pricier than normal"
"Is your app dumb or something, can't login because there is no option to login and it wants me to make a new account. But can't use my email because i already have an account......."
I simply enjoy the app. It keeps you up to speed with the progress and delivery. Its user friendly and saves me time.
Promotion cide redeemed but nowhere to be seen
So good foods it's so yummy
Easy to use. Whole process is seamless
I waited 1 hour for my order to not even show up but it said it arrived. Couldn't get in touch with the driver it was going to voice mail. All I ordered is a drink. I actually left my house and in 25 mins I was back home with my drink . The customer service is terrible: the app told me to call the helpline and then the helpline which was difficult to hear almost as if they want you to give up. Then once I entered my number in the helpline told me to go to the app. Never again.
Very good
Excellent service
The actual price of hotels are law and some hotels uber eats get more price
I just love tje app
"Very easy to use, I like how you have the option to tip them after you get your food."
Fast delivery
"Used to love the app, but they've rasied the delivery charge, as well as the food prices. I understand prices go up but when there's a 150% increase on delivery charge, and they're marking up food 30%-45% from what the restaurant charges, that's too much. I've also had numerous problems with delivery instructions."
Superb
One time good offer for first user
"Its out from india, totally sad"
Nice App
💪
👍👍👍
Awesome
Tried to order food for 3 hours bt it keep showing varify payment though i choose cash as payment method.
This does not work.
Waste app cant open app properly
Super
Love it!
Awful The 3 times that I ordered it was a 2 hour and a half wait and the 4th time I ordered the restaurant had to cancel the order because they qere closing
Lowest service i have ever seen quit it has to be 00
"I dont have a previous account. Ive never used this app, and it wont allow me to register. Going to grubhub!"
"Still use the app, but poor customer service. We ordered a breakfast that came in 2h23min after we ordered and it arrived cold and dry. They refused to cancel the order before it arrived (which we tried after wainting 1h30min) and refused to give any incentive following the order. (We didn't really eat anything..). I never write reviews, but this time i had to. We expected more Issue was not resolved. I still had to pay the 2 breakfasts we didn't eat.."
The worst app iv ever seen
Easy to use and helps stop the hunger
Professional
Love the wide options of fast food restaurants and the notifications when drivers is on route easy to use app widnae be without it 😁
Excellent app with prompt response
It does not process the order. I just got the app and I haven't been able to process any of my orders it simply does not work. I do not recommend it.
Good
Good
Nice app
It doesnt work at all always mentions that there is a problem.
"Terrible, delievies take so long and food is always cold"
"Menus don't have language option, otherwise it's very good"
"What a truly terrible app paired with a company that already thinks it's too successful to offer quality customer service. If you order from this atrocity, triple-check your delivery address and payment method because the app doesn't have a verification step for either. If you accidentally order to the wrong address, you will have to either take the loss and let your delivery driver eat the meal that you paid for or hope that your driver is cooperative and nice enough to meet you"
Now its shwng to go to zomato😕 M nt able to order frm it nw..wt should i do
I can't even order anything! I'm not into the menu I just logged in and they ask me for my address then says my order is on the way even though I didn't order anything!
very disappointing
"Great, the food comes in great condition a little hot really good."
Gud
Was lovely thank you and didn't wait long thank you so much
GOOD
Will never use again made a order over £27 order not arrived asked for a immediate refund not getting anywhere
Good
Excellent service! You can get your favourite meal from your favourite restaurant delivered to you home.......what more could you want!? 🤯
I got a due after I played my correct amount but after I called and enquired they made the due amount zero This app was very helpful and is helpful fr eaters specially like me🤪🤤🙂
Excellent
Love it
App works great and fast service
Awesome
"Fees are way too high. It's cheaper to get an uber to the restaurant, pick up your food and head back home."
Not enough oversight if a restaurant delivers really late. No alternative to 'call them'. If they dont answer then no plan B. Food arrived over an 1hrs late. Ubereats should know this and offer discounts from the offending restaurant if this happens.
There are no options to cancle or change my order after few seconds orderd.
"Terrible app, not working!"
Was slow and poor
Slow kept having to refresh to place order
Quick service at your doorstep
"Great app up until a few months ago when not even the addresses pop up. Only a error message for about 3 months now. I've tried updating, uninstalling and downloading for the same thing to happen and I cannot make it pass the address screen, I lose all my discounts and credits for no reason 👎👎"
"Had two terrible experiences in a row. First one we waited over 80 minutes to receive our order. No traffic or any peak hours that could have affected the order. Second time one third of a Large coldrink was spilled out, and everything was wet. To top that, two burgers was missing from the meal, and instead there was a jalapeno burger in their place, we dont eat jalapenos! The items that was received, was cold and not fresh. Never ordering from Uber eats again. Waste of time and not worth it"
your acnt does not have password cnt use ur app

"Problems loading App. Starts at ""add address page"" rather than normal home page. Inputting adress just brings up ""error inputting location information"". Going ""back"" only exits the app. Have cleared cache and makes no difference."
Never had no problems with uber eats and they've always 'delivered' good customer service. Can't live without it!
I can't get a delivery to my area
Really good
Terrible app...
"""We're not quite where you are yet"" YUP!"
I received a totally wrong order from them and they refused to take responsibility for this problem telling me that I had to call the restaurant and cancel the order! Why would I cancel the order? I need to eat and this is why I ordered in the first place. Getting the wrong items is your responsibility since I have no control or knowledge of what is inside the bag. The food prices are more expensive than it's price on the restaurants. Would never use it without a 50% discount or something.
"I talk about the service. Worst year after year. They say less fees if the restaurant is close to you, but it's 4£ for something at 1km from your house, I can't imagine farest. They say 10-20min but at the end it's 50min minimum, 1h at latest, for any kind of restaurant. You can never use your Uber credit, even if you select it, they charge you anyway. They charge you if the restaurant cancel. Delivery don't come to you, you have to move somewhere to pick up your food (but you pay 4 pounds?!)"
Awesome
Better
Zomato shouldn't have acquired uber eats... 😛😛 50% off upto Rs.100. Fractionally thugs!!
Terrible. Two orders places through Uber eats. The first time we received someone elses order and it took til the next day to get a refund - by which point it was too late. Second time we had food missing and Uber refused to refund as I'd had to complain twice in a row!
Doesnt work i keep ordering food but the wrong item keep turning up and then when I ask for a refund because the only edible thing on a £22 order is £1.60 worth of hash brown they give you £8 back seem reasonable to me
useless I can't use it because I am very rural backpacker sorry for the strange language but all the time if I watch sth on YouTube the add comes on I really have no use for it just go out and go in the restaurant by yourself there is nothing wrong about this but don't hide behind the internetti if you are hungry you never get good conversations s
Been using the app for ages recently it's been glitchy dont know if it's a new update or my phone
"Always there when I need it, use often and it works"
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌💪💪😘😋
Amazing app 😍😍
دائما يغلط بالطلب
First time used and was very happy. Quick and friendly and the food was hot and tasty. Thankyou
not worth it.
Exceptional always great service at all times
"Thank you for reminding me why I chose data science instead of mobile development. Not even a company as large and shameful in employee treatment as Uber can get it right. 90 Mins ago did I order, 45 minutes the driver has been at the restaurant. To those reading reviews I'd recommend doordash because if something goes wrong you can actually contact them. EDIT: Response is exactly what I mean. Not even Uber knows their own features. You can't contact in these situations. It says wait."
"Has worked brilliant everytime, and fastest delivery out there"
Sometimes difficult to navigate when ordering. If you have been given a loyalty voucher/money off it doesn't automatically link to the app and as a result have missed out on a discount.
They cancelled my order
My last review was removed because I was being honest. Terrible service I won't use again.
Food was great. The garlic butter needed more garlic and there wasn't enough for the amount of chips. The 'raw fish'...wasn't raw fish👎 Other than that...the rest of our meal was great😁
Great
Awful customer service and support.
Customer service is actually disgusting. Horrible people. Every time something goes wrong it's your fault 😤
Well Designed!
Good
Issues after issues atm
Not working. Showing Uber Eats acquired by Zomato
Great
I'm fat and don't like talking to people. Lovely.
Good stuff
The maps for the drivers need to be more accurate. Have ordered a couple of times and it sends them to a different address
Exceptional!!!
"Nice app..if we can see areal photos of the restaurant, it will be great..."
Useless to complain about a driver when all you're told is that they'll investigate but 2 weeks later no one follows up
Worst app experience both of the apps uberrides and ubereats in my life . I was just book a ride at Delhi Airport around 3 o clock and enter payment adding method but not booked ride I m booked Ola ride instead uber then I saw my paytm account at evening I m shocked 477.56 rupees deducted by uber eats that a illegal robbery .
Gud
"Great, free food please"
"Usually good but right now, the only thing I can do with the app is ""enter a new address"", its the only screen that shows, and the app WONT let me enter any address. It wont search for an address either. The app is completely useless right now. Cant get support from within the app or anything either because it wont let me move from this one screen which isnt functioning."
Kkk
Super easy to use and great indicator of when delivery is.
"App is not opening, always say it is occupied by Zomato"
Didn't get back to me and the driver just left.. He didn't even check the order when he left the restaurant.
"Overall good but this last time I spent 15 bucks plus tip on a simple McDonalds meal from the location down the street (less than a mile away). It was preparing for a good 40 minutes, was delivered fairly quick. I got a soggy cold burger with fries the same temperature of my drink. Overall very disappointed to have spend twice the amount I would have spend to get it myself if i was off work. I paid more for below standard 😕"
Really sad you guys I can't take it anymore you charged me for the order that you didn't even place it you took the money from my card but no order how and I couldn't report it because because you guys ask for the order number which I don't have plz give me back my money I am sick of it.
So convenient when you don't want to go out or feel like cooking
Is the content of the in english
Good app
"After 30 min ""could not complete your order"". Awesome!"
What do you expect
Sab kam frji
It didn't take my order.Everything was ok but I couldn't place order.
Very quick service
"Long delivery wait for up to an hour. Not impressed. No direct contact w. CS. ********* Reply to UE. You might want to check your messages. If you would - then you'd see I already raised this concern w. you. Check your feedbacks. Btw, one time my order was ""damaged"" by driver wo even advising me. Ended up waiting for over an hour to find out no delivery would be made. Offered $10 discount, for dinner that we did not have, which they did not even credit. Terrible."
Love it
Driver pulled off with my order and I never received a refund for that order so he basically got a free meal with my hard earned money. Very upset about that.
Its amazing and they diliver your food
One of the best food app and best restaurants are Added with uber ! Nice !!
Uber Eats was super. Don't why they stopped thier services. Zomato and swiggy isn't good. Missing Uber Eats.
It's very easy and quick it's all ways on time if only there were more locations available I would give it five stars
Working good
Theeeeeee best ever
Good
Very useful when there's not alot of options around you.
Taco bell please that is all
"User friendly, plenty of options, quick and friendly curriers."
Great
"Able to now order hsp for the 4th time in 1 day without leaving my house, thanks uber eats"
"Fast, Brilliant service"
"No help when you have an issue, and deceptive charging practices that drive up your total after you've ordered."
Drivers stop being careful
why you keep cancelling my orders??
Sometimes it's issues with someone picking it up so the food be cold
So useful!! 👌👍
Worst bro don't download
Convenient.
Great app and how easy it is to order and pay. Uber eats delivers on there word. Definitely will be using it again.
Love it
It's quick and good food. Not much range yet though can't even get McDonald's or KFC. But everything is amazing
Always prompt & polite.
"Delivery driver is literally texted where my apartment is, by me. I see his car in front of my complex, he didn't get out of his car. Canceled my order and drove off. Hope he enjoys my family's dinner. Because we sure as hell aren't. If I could give this app a zero, I would."
Fantastic
Get food delivered you couldn't before but far more expensive.
very user friendly!
"Had $215 order from taco cabana ,then cancel it but instead of 215 it 179, can someone explain because i barley click order then cancel . clay rd"
"I've used ubereats out of necessity, my most recent order was horrible. The driver took over an hour to get here from a place that's 8 minutes away, food was cold, and uber has yet to respond to my report"
I ordered from uber eats just recently and I had a missing order. No support or customer service to get help and no contact number of the driver to contact. This is the worst delivery service i had. I'll never order from here again.
"I can't anymore with this app. Every delivery either has wrong items, missing drink, or entirely wrong order."
Great service
Great easy to use
💓💓💓💓
Bomb
Best thing
Not all the information is in English.
Okey
Doesn't tell you how the wait is.
More technical issues.
So frustrated with this app..I haven't had it for more then 5 mins and I'm already done with it..the app won't register either of my emails.. saying they both are already have exsisting accounts.. not too sure why it would say that considering I haven't ever used this service before.. now I pretty much can't
The prices were really hiked like almost double what it really was .how can we guarantee that its not triple layered and we buying food for third parties? The prices should be the same as the restaurants walk in menu then this will work very successfully .
It's so expensive with all the different fees and then the hike in the price of food versus when you go inside to the restaurant
Great
"I did not receive my order after it said delivered on the app, i havent received an answer for more than 50 minutes after reporting what happened.. i could not call the driver or any support for help.. never ordering from uber eats again"
i just ordered for the first time through uber eats last night and i got frozen yogurt. it arrived 8 mins earlier then they said it would and it was still frozen. i just put in an order for pad thai. if it goes just as well then this will stay at 5 stars..what an awesome app for a stay at home momma with special needs child.
The app still has problems like loading... Specifically.
Get food from your fav local joints and keep your jammies on. You can't get mad at that.
Takes to long to find a driver then on top of that you can't cancel without paying $17.00! This will be the last time I order ANYTHING through Uber eats!!!!
Fantastic💚
"Horrible customer experience. Use to be good. Before if there was a problem with the order, they would fix the issue. Almost every order has an issue now in the last 6 months. Customer support can't do anything to help at all. Walking deliveries are also pointless in the Canadian winters. Won't be using the app again."
"Generally love this app but it doesn't load any addresses for delivery destination and doesn't go past that screen even after cache clear, force stop and reinstalling the app"
"Food is almost always of good service & quality , i just think the total price for the food, delivery, tax & tip are way too high."
Nicely done
Food arrives cold support is terrible. Deleted app i imagine they will end up going bust look at the reviewsl
"Sad the drivers let the app down, no shows, poor excuses as to why they didn't show."
Easy to use and wonderful service. Breast delivery fees I've seen and no mark ups on prices
Forgot salsa
Love it!
"stupid app, says my phone nr is registered.. then it asks for a pw.. dont know it obviously try to request my pw.. asks for email.. tried ALL my email addresses non work"
"The food was good. However, my condiments request was ignored or forgotten. - Kimberly"
Do Not Use This App! I work in the food service industry and deal with the other side of your order. Drivers often arrive 15-30 minutes after they are supposed to. That's even if they arrive at all. Customers have come to our store to pick up their order because there's no way to contact the driver or UberEats after waiting hours for their delivery and watching the driver's GPS location never move. Use Door Dash instead. They are always early for pick up and are so much more professional.
Deveria haver a opção de confirmar o endereço de entrega antes de concluir o pedido
"Really not happy with this crowd, you give me $30 off and soon as I place an order the promo expires and my order has been cancelled, when I try and do the order again the app keeps saying went wrong then I'm finding out I'm trying to be charged for an order that wasn't placed, 0/10, I'll take my services else where"
"I ordered a meal for 2 using this app and after delivery realized that I was missing half my order. I was confused as I was charged for both meals. There is no way to get any sort of immediate assistance and I emailed customer service but didn't get so much as an auto reply. There is no way to leave feedback about the driver (other than a thumbs down), see his rating, and this guy apparently pocketed the extra cash instead of filling my whole order. I will stick with Postmates from now on!"
Absolutley love this Service!!
D-
Easy to use
Way better than skip the dishes
Perfect
Always on time and correct orders
Constant issues/errors
The orders wouldn't place.
Awesome!!!
Amazing
Usually the fastest food delivery service and the best customer service. Anytime something is wrong they're quick to make it right without having to leave the app compared to other apps that require an exchange of emails for results.
Phenomenal and super cheap!
"Its not worth using if you're just 1 person ordering. With taxes, delivery fees and tip the bill is stupidly expensive. Even if you're 2. Overall its way more expensive than just calling up the restaurant directly. But i give it 3 stars for convenience."
Service fee of 10% and small order fee of $2 is just a fraudulent excuse to Scam users... Skip The Dish remains the best and preferred.. I won't use Uber Eat anymore and I advice others to stay away
good
Very easy to use and the selection is growing. Food is always hot and delicious.
Terrible! There is no way to cancel an order once it's been placed!!! I accidentally hit the wrong button and no way to go back!
"I do have the worthest experience with using this app. The delivery guy is super rude and also just cancelled our order only because he can't fine my home! I camw down for finding him, and nobody is there. Super bad, waiting a long time for nothing just a rude call. Called the customer service, they said they cannot help."
Slow and useless
تطبيق جدا رهيب الشي الي يميزه عن غيره سرعته في التوصيل
So far for my first order everything was pretty good easy to use deliver was on point no complains so far
A wonderful app to get access to food you normally can't access through delivery.
Good for when i cant be bothered going out
"This is a great app, I appreciate you selecting great friendly personnel and great restaurants"
Absolutely thrilling for the whole audience constant edge of the seat suspense in the last 3 seconds I got free delivery
I love this app. Having no transportation makes things very difficult so having this app is so convenient! I recommend it every chance i get!
Our order was not correct we had no water with the Happy meal and no bbq dip with the nugget meal. Also the fries were cold so when tried to ring macdonalds they were closed.
Otimos descontos e interface
It was over my expectation and I will use it again.
"Very disappointed, I used to order several times a week but since moving house I'm 100 metres outside of their delivery area!"
Great
A life saver. Thank you!
"Seems this used-to-be-good app is falling victim to the ""fix what isn't broken"" mentality of so many apps. It's getting worse and worse. Promotions don't work right or sometimes at all. Sometimes the app won't even let me log in, requiring me to add an address already saved to my account, payments sometimes fail for no reason, causing you to have to try repeatedly."
The best delivery guy ever. He actually waited more than needed
Having a problem with ordering at address I am located at
It works
😫😫😫😫
Now only one place is avaiable to choose from which never ever happens plus you have no online help
Great
Simply fabulous 👌
Awesome
Careful pay attention to your charges
There's no way to contact someone at Uber when you have a problem with your order and driver!! Going back to grubhub
"Great selection, nice being able to see your driver get close, and the “share a driver” with a nearby order feature is fantastic."
Awesome
Just getting started so far so good
I drive with Uber also but I still order all the time from them! Awesome service always
"Never works for me no idea why, I just stick to deliveroo and they do better discounts and vouchers"
Dosent deliver to any area i choose
"Great, smooth and easy."
Great
Very poor customer service and the drivers cancel anytime they want to and refuse to deliver food to a prison
The app is great I just wish I could afford to use it more often.
Do not use this app if you live in the Netherlands. Deliveries never turn up and you will still be charged as the restaurants seem to just say it was delivered and Uber will then help you no further. Good in the UK though
Watched delivery on map went to every road but ours was very late food was stone cold
on TIME & accurate order!
Would be better if it accepted cash
Placed an order it got cancelled and I got charged for it but the icing on the cake I was charged even more then the agreed price. When I shouldn't have been charged at all.
Los descuentos del 59 son la Ostia
"The app is fine, but I've received too many phone calls from couriers who've told me to come downstairs because they can't find parking and/or don't match their photo. I even had one tell me that they're ""not allowed to go into buildings."" What?? In NYC?? LIES! First of all, I live in THE safest neighborhood in NYC. Plus, it's NYC; no way can you work for UE and never go into buildings here. I never have these issues with DoorDash or Seamless. I'll be using them as often as I can."
ابليكشن وحش اوى وكمان الدعم مش بيرد على اى مشكله وبتدفع فلوس اكتر غير اللى مكتوب
"I was charged for an order that I had canceled, when I enquiring about the money it said to wait seven to ten days then let them know , now I am told that I waited to long therefore I will not receive my money back. Your a whole corporation but won't return my 31.00 back , are you serious ? I am going to delete my app as you will not get another penny of my money. I should let the BBB know how you ooerate."
Is mcdonalds on here? As I can't seem to find??
"Awful awful service, we ordered advised on the way and a minute after it was due to be delivered they advised order was cancel even though the driver was only a minute away, advised drivers car had broken down and that we could not collect"
When I try opening. It says it's aquired by zomato and zomato app opens up. Is this real?
Very good
I have had a very good experience with the orders so far. Everything on time and no issues whatsoever. Keep improving!
Good
Great
Trash app nothing work when i check out used all my cards and nothing dont waste your time with this trash ass app..Good day
It's ok
"I like it but not the wait, really wish starbucks was on here"
Logging in Is very bad. Terrible. I'm trying to make an account and it tells me to enter a password. I NEVER MADE AN ACCOUNT. And there is not other way to reset password.
Very bad. Couldn't find address at all. Only errors.
"SCAM! SCAM! AVOID! DISGUSTING! Outrageous customer service, never sends correct food/always missing items, then refuses refund! customer service is a joke! claims to help with your issue then refuses! SCAM ARTISTS! APAULING! Incompetent drivers! Sends damaged soggy food, drinks fallen over!"
Stupid driver couldn't find me even though I was at a tollway service are
"Trying to send a prepared meal to family members 4 states away struggling with health issues who needed a little pick-me-up from their favorite local restaurant. Uber Eats made it easy! I could track the prep, package, and delivery. Gave a heads up to delivery person about the situation and heads up to family members who was coming, when, what car, and license plate. For about 2 minutes of my time, I come off as a HERO to my family. Best ""good will"" ambassador program around."
Good Food
"Wish it were possible to put negative stars, company is trash drivers, support etc"
Very helpful when I need food late at night
It disappoints as often as it impresses. I wish the latter were more frequent.
Made us fat time to say goodbye
Good
Worst App. A drain on the poor delivery driver's mental and social health.
If I could give a worse rating I would! They gave me a doordash order for some one eles and has things that I allergic to and still hasn't gotten back to me!
"cada vez están peor, no aceptan cupones ya, cobran demasiado por envíos 35 pesos la mayoría de los restaurantes es un robo, además de que no te apoyan en nada, pésima calidad y atención ya hay muchas otras aplicaciones, lástima porque era hn cliente regular, pero no les importa nada el cliente"
Overall I think the fees are high
"My order, although right around the corner from me, was too far to be delivered. When attempting to order from another restaurant nearby, other items that were in my cart from my previous order couldn't be deleted because the location was too far."
Loads of problems applying a payment method so never using again not worth a w..k still hungry too nearly an hour and half just to be told card not added neither was my PayPal if you dont like being disappointed and hungry get a different app
Have never had a problem. Every driver I've had has been awesome. Love this app
Excellent.
Very slow
Works great most of the time
Was very hard kept reseting and not saving
Driver ran off with my food
My deliveries have been great!!! Keep up the good work!!
"Uber eats is the worst app, I had a very disappointing experience today when I ordered food for lunch and it took way too long when I tried to cancel the order, the support also took way too long to answer wow what a bad bad experience. Still ubereats says it'll improve but it gets worse and worse. Other food delivery apps are way better."
Everything is easily found a lot more restaurants are covered
Gigs job
Really good.
My phone number is apprently associated with someone elses uber account so it wont allow me to sign into this app.
I had an issue where I use this app and now it doesn't work I phoned and emailed Uber eats to resolve this problem yet after a few months I still can't use this app anymore :/
Its gooood
"I'm not sure what is going on with Uber Eats, but I'm being charged days later and then refunded and charged again, with no explanation from Uber Eats in an email! There is no way to talk to a real person when you need to figure out the random charges! The ""Help"" section is laughable. Thinking I might switch to Doordash or SkipTheDishes permanently, never had problems with them. And you think you are saving $ with the way they have changed delivery fees, but you don't, they get you with a $2 fee"
Excellent so far
It's a very good & awesome app ❤
It takes ages to recognise our location and won't let us order from places we have previously ordered from
Burger King 163 Madison Worcester order never delivered but my paypal was charged. My app says order was cancelled at 11:53 am but my account was still charged!!!!
Gud services...
Always works for me
"Fast, efficient and great app. Best food ordering delivery service app there is."
Really poor service
Easy to use
Same issue as other users - app fails to locate my delivery address suddenly after working well for years. App is stuck on delivery lookup and fails to load any location data. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling as well as clearing my app cache in settings. The real last straw was leaving the Uber website help page frustrated with no one to contact to fix my issue! Thanks for nothing. #hangry
I wish they would accept Google pay or Apple
My experience with the last order was the worst. Pizza inn ojijo charges me for food that I didn't even eat
I cant receive the reset password link?
Installed app ordered macs entered card details then nothing re. entered card details 3 times nothing gave up
Very Good
I had 1year 2 years ago made an account on a old phone number and used the same email address I have now and when I tried making another account it would let me because I had already used that email address and it was an old phone number. But that's the only problem. Delivery fees but pricey
Awesome service
"The app it doesn't work anymore. When I confirmed my payment it says an error has occurred. When I use it online to order my food. It works, so for now on I have been ordering thru online ."
Uber Eats is taken over by Zomato and we can't place any order from this application. Then why are you even here on the Play Store?
I have forgotten my password and the email I used to make my uber eats account. I now can't login and I can't delete my account as I don't remember my password. I tried to call the customer care numbers but nothing is working. What can I do ? Can uber tell me what account I used to make my account ? Or if they can delete my number
"Drivers seldom get the order right, always bits missing. On one occasion food was actually stolen and never arrived. Tried calling establishment but they refused to send out another order because as far as they were concerned the order was fulfilled. Zero trust in Uber or its employees."
"I've used this app a lot before, except now it has become inaccessible because every time I try to open it, it brings me to the delivery details, and I can't add my address. I've tried deleting and reinstalling it, and deleting the cache, but still nothing is working."
Good
"So I like uber eats. And started back using them recently. Well, I had a 50% coupon that was suppose to expire on the 3rd if I'm not mistaken. Called and they told me they can't do anything about it. Now I use uber and uber eats and was disappointed to say the least"
Order was never picked up
"Why do I need to give you my mobile number before I can even look at the app, how do I even know if there is a restaurant that delivers near me? UPDATE Imagine my surprise, when after going through more security checks than I did when I set up my online banking, there are no restaurants in my area.....what a waste of my time....."
Really great service
Got new phone and number but wont let me sign in. Wants me to type new phone number then when I type in my email it says this email is already registered. So why is there not a sign in button?
Good
I'm loving it!
Unable to search location and I have enabled location services also..
Been great
Please remove your app from playstore
Great service and always on time
"Can't use App, it tells me how MY ACCOUNT DOESN'T HAVE A PASSWORD and this error occurs only when I'm about to get started."
The food is always delivered hot and on time.
Really good
Just need less fees
"UBER EATS STOLE MY MONEY! On 11. Oct 2019 I ordered food delivery using the Uber Eats Android Application. I chose PayPal as a payment method. After selecting food items and clicking the pay button I received an error message stating that the payment was not successful and that I should make a new order. I closed the application and reopened it, reselecting the items. I payed by VISA card. Approximately 30 minutes later I received an Email stating the Paypal payment is also successful and my ord"
The service is excellent!
Not able to register showing your password does not exist
"Constant delays, food never arrives at serving temperature. Just waited over an hour for a delivery that would've taken 15 minutes to drive to, order, and bring home. Don't have this issue with other delivery services"
Way to expensive and sometimes vendors on uber charge way more on the app than in store or thru their own delivery.
Very very very bad
Wish uber eats had wendys and chic fil a
App is easy to use and tracking and communicating with drivers is very helpful
I got food back in december from dennys the food was not eatable they refunded the money. Some time between then and late week they decided to add part of it back on that was not right ok now i go to get my grandkids breakfast early one morning after work from mc donalds ubet eat took it upon there aelfs to charge my card 36.38 and cancled my mcdonalds my grandkids didnt get to eat and i still have not gottin a message back from from u all in 8 day told me it would take 5 days at the most.
Enjoy the app it's very nice to be able to get the food I like without leaving work!
Wont find my address and doesn't allow me to enter it manually. Useless.
Very glitchy. Dosn't always recognise delivery address or delivery details.
Drivers in London don't deliver your food. Beware.
It works well
Why when i open uber eats it show zomato
best
"I had a terrible experience with ubereats I received an email from uber eats claiming that I have not paid my driver the full amount of my order and that 242.80 is due(which is the full amount). I have, no doubt, paid my driver more than the full amount. I gave him R270 (I paid extra as a tip) so I was outraged by this email. I wasn't even alone, I was accompanied by my cousin to the front gate. Why would the driver give us the food but not take the money? Does that make sense?"
"Used to work great and usually was faster than DoorDash but there's just so many bugs lately. For a while there was a credit card issue where any CC you put it would say invalid (DD was working). For the longest time I've been experiencing a bug you see in many other reviews, it can't pull up any addresses. I'm a former Android dev; I've tried the basics clearing cache, clearing app data, reinstalling, force-killing, nothing works. Uber's had so many layoffs so that's part of it I'm sure..."
This app is trash
"You, uber eats, were Amazing however It's sad that you had to sell your company to a horrible brand like Zomato (India)"
"It's ok in a jam. But unless I am traveling, I don't really use the app since prices are pretty expensive."
Very great
Great
Good delivery.
Awesome
Fraud
My first order was paid in cash... But the driver hasn't paid the money to the restaurant. Now I'm can't order anything because of this.
"I love this app. Food was hot and fresh. If i picked it up, it would have been cold about time i got home. Will be using this app more often."
Always on point and food is hot
"App has declined over past year or so: No immediate emailed confirmation when submitting orders. They do this so that you forget when you submitted your order. Their algorithms are designed to manipulate. Consistently hires drivers who scam or lie about their form of transportation. Order receipt fails to include name, time, and pay method; info is too limited. Service fees are higher than competitors like GrubHub and DoorDash. Promotions are unrealistic. Overall, there are better options."
I ordered my food. food did not come but delivery was marked as delivered. Driver was unable to be contact throughout the order and didnt bother to contact me. There is a reception at my place that will gladly take order if the driver was unable to find me (which was weird because I was searching for him). I went to the extent and asked the neighbourhood building if there was a food delivery but nothing. waited half an hour just to have me and my friend left starving.DENIED REFUND AS WELL! 0/5
"I've used Uber Eats a lot and generally found it to be reliable. However, in the past 6 months I've had multiple orders fail to deliver and be canceled after I've waited 45+min, with no attempt from the driver to contact me and absolutely no help from support (other than ""you weren't charged""). It's frustrating to be waiting for up to an hour only to be left empty-handed, and ""not being charged"" for something I never received is little consolation. I'll be uninstalling and using a competitor. Edit in response to developer comment: the details are in my conversations with Uber support. If you would like to see them, please let me know what I can reference, since there doesn't seem to be an obvious ticketing system being used by your customer service team."
Convenient
Great. Does what it needs to. No complaints.
"They did a update to the app this year that makes it virtually impossible to get ahold of customer service, even when you step outside the app and start looking for Uber customer service on Google."
The delivery fees are too high and services aren't that good
Excelente
Makes life easy.
Amazing app
Very bad support and too much delays
Fast and efficient!
Can't even get onto the app
Ok. I give up on you! Crappy apps! I've uninstall 3x in 1year and I've been active user since uber started. This us my last time I'm going to delete the apps. Also I would like to totally delete EVERYTHING as whenever I reinstall you guys still seems to know. Please let me know how to totally delete EVERYTHING For this I drop my phone 3x as I'm so ANNOYED
"By far the worst out of the food delivery services. I love Uber but Uber eats consistently has issues. The arrival time is Always longer than estimated many times by 20-30 min more. Food quality suffers, and my last order had drinks but no food. They offered a $5 credit that never showed up. Not worth it"
Pls service for us it is connecting to Zomato We need your technology not Zomato
How to remove old email id and mention another 1
I like uber eats
Great app for food
The driver didn't have enough change so I had to give him extra money 🙄
Excellent
"Expensive (with delivery & tip), but worth it."
Very good
"Worst support ever. I sent them multiple pictures and videos of my order being completely wrong, and they implied I was lying to get a refund, and that if I insisted my account would be banned. I also asked for a GDPR data request, they said they'd send it ASAP, and then ignored me. I've been waiting for months now."
"no way to make instant complain inside the app. food is still preparing after order placed for 1.x hour. And when try to cancel the order, the refund deduct the delivery fee, which is waived during payment. super poor experience"
It's a great and easy to use app but it always takes longer for the delivery to come than expected by at least 15 mins every time.
It's irritating to give addressed many times Worst app
I love it! Easy peasy!
It’s very good
Powli
"After one hour waiting for the order, they told me that my order is cancelled & i can reorder !!"
The best.
Its my first and best foodie app
Diliver in right time right place
Quick and convenient
Very fast
I love uber eats better than any other food deliveries apps honestly.
Appalling. Took almost 45minutes to deliver from Kingston. I live in SW20. He said he was sent the wrong address. No apology. Food cold and was missing one item. If I could give this service negative stars I would. £25 totally wasted
The app stops at once. And most of the shops we prefer are almost closed everytime.
"The app is very convenient, when you want to try food at different restaurants on your on time."
"App doesn't work. Asks for address only, I can't put an order in."
Reall goooood and cheap when buying food but the thing is that the GPS is inaccurate
اوسخ شركه في العاااالم. The badest company on the earth I'll never stop to make a complains
"Great, Quick and Easy!"
In 85% of every place the menu is missing items to item./
Not working in India
F.... First install and then install zomato again.
"No contact number, you just cancle my order with in a second and loot my money I will never order again on your app"
Y is the App now acquired by Zomato.. uberv eats was solely the best....delivery charges are very high in zomato...
USE DOORDASH!!! $65 worth of inedible food. I reported it with Uber eats and they did nothing. I called the resturant and they told me to call Uber eats. With DOORDASH they at least give you a credit for the inedible food.
"Less promotional offers, less options for choosing restaurants"
Not what I ordered 😡
Every thing about this service was good until they jacked the prices with pointless fee's. Now it's to expensive to even be worth it with the 15% service fee.
Nope. My food was prepared then picked up then driven 20 minutes away from me before being delivered. Not using this app again anytime soon and will not recommend to ANYONE....
Fast
Horrible experience I'm hungry t r.c y this app it lets me order get all the way thru everything and it cancels my order 3 times and now the restuaranrmt wont even take my order anymore
"U get them fast, fresh nd hot"
I cannot tip! :(
Fantastic service
A plus
"Я не розумію чому, але додаток відмітив моє замовлення доставленим, хоча кур'єр писав, що ще на шляху до мене. І так я його і не отримала. А потім просто моє замовлення відобразилось, як доставлене. Гроші, звичайно, знялись. Чекаю на повернення протягом 3-10 бізнес днів, як і було зазначено у додатку. Не буду більше користуватись"
Best delivery
"Terrible customer service. Restaurant delivers wrong order and do not answer their phone. Uber eats 'support' took 9 hours to respond. Sent them a picture of the wrong order (which may I add, I did not eat) and their 'support' claims there is nothing that they can do. The delivery driver who was a apparently going to be a female on a bike ended up being a male in a car, the food order wasnt sealed. I'm out of pocket, but much wiser. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
I like the food they send and it is hot
Easy to use
"horrendous service this is by far the worst app i have ever used, made an oreder nevee arrived, contacting UBER is impossible never respond to a message. cant make a complaint there is no feature on there app, DO NOT USE!!! update, i got a refund 48hrs later, still the app os horrendous as there is no way to complain even when i found a number to call thr advisor stated he cant help because the order is classed as delivered. My advice, DO NOT USE! Going bqck to tried and trusted JUST EAT."
good
1st time user waited and watched tracker only yo see driver pick up and then after 30min wait have the ordered cancelled by them. Called restraurant and confirmed order was collected. Hope you enjoyed our meal Mr uber driver! Won't be using Uber eats again!!!
I got charged twice and proved it and got a response to shut down my account still have not got my money
Amazing
"Always great service from drivers, food arrives quick and app allows me to tip the drivers fairly"
No being able to sign up. It says 'your account does not have a password ' everytime I write my phone number. How to fix this?
Was good for the first use but changed and the 3 stars lost because I can't order anymore
Trash
Fantastic .. very easy to use
I can't use it... I donno why
Food is constantly delivered with issues.
Good
Good and helpful
App de entregador bandido. Fiz um pedido e o entregador sabendo das falhas do app não fez a entrega e ainda por cima ficou com o pedido pra ele.
Aweome ! I'm never gonna starve again thanks to this.
Had to heat all the food and drinks up and ordered porridge and syrup and just got porridge. Not impressed.
"Paid for 2 orders. Got 0 orders. I was told it's bc I cancelled one order after they started it, but it was 30 seconds after I order it. The 2nd order that I purchased & did not receive was bc I allegedly changed my address after the order was placed. Since before they completed my meal at IHOP, the only address showed was my current location. I then manually sent the address to the man and he said he was on the way. I was then called by uber & told he was not coming & I have to pay. HBD 2 ME :("
"Exceptional, the sevice is great. I received a wrong order and it was dealt with better restuarants that you would go to everyday, uber eats is the best"
Very bad
The drivers are never on time
Good
"Horrible customer service, missing food from the order, app doesn't work as soon as you raise a complaint. Use Deliveroo or JustEat instead."
Great
"Terrible service, terrible customer service. Just all around terrible. Sucks we have to use them at all. Hopefully you'll go bankrupt, when all that venture capital dries up."
Just improve your discount facilities
"It's not possible to order items and when it's not possible to contact customer support, always they are sending offers I can't make the first order."
"Great app, ever i have seen"
Jdjud
Good Service
Good
Can't delete payment method. Other then that good Edit: there is no option to send you a note on your website/app. And I found out that is impossible to delete the only payment method...
Super
Pretty good. Few issues getting a voucher to work at first but managed it in the end
It has become worst of all food delivery services. Delivery man contact doesn’t show up. They deliver food after 2 hours even sometimes 3 hours late from the estimated delivery time often. The customer service is worst. They promise to send credit for next deliveries and for being late at their service. But eventually they don't do it.
They don't deliver onetime
Worked no problem
A simple way to order a meal. A wide variety of options avalible.
They should make me their ambassador. That's how much I order from here.
Fast and efficient Great service Lots of options
Super app for Quality food delivery in UAE
Tasty and easy
Uber eats was great until just now when they declined all my cards which has money by the way. I can't order and I want my wings!
Very good service and fast too
Good
Awesome
Superb
Great app
Non functional
Uber eats should be able to take multiple orders at the same time. Example placing orders at Mcdonald and KFC at the same time. That would be much better.
Convenient
Absolutely awesome. The food was so good.
Horrible application with service and delay in food delivery.
Excellent
I liked
Good
Nig
Why the hell would you still keep this app up on the store when it just leads you to zomato
Prices are way too high
Sorry I am
I can't apply promo it crashed and then said I already used it. Trash app
"Orders frequently cancelled for no reason after taking forever, but using a different app works fine"
Love it
How can I track my order on the map when I only get a map that is like one cm cant in large the
Not gd
"Only complaint is that the app doesn't flag anything if the driver leaves before the 8 minutes is up, has screwed me over a couple times."
Improve your app performance. I am not able to login everytime. Waste of my time
Useless don't know how to use no one to help
"The App works well if everything goes to plan, but there is no way to contact drivers or a Call Centre when there is a problem. The Help function is not that helpful"
Service is good.
Quick and easy and not expensive
I received a wrong order and Uber gave no support whatsoever at the time despite the restaurant itself being helpful. I had guests over who had to go back hungry because Uber refused to send any kind of support.  Uber should make sure that their delivery drivers ensure that they are picking up the correct order at the restaurant itself. It's Uber's responsibility that the correct order reaches the customer else their is no need of a delivery service like this.
Great app For Delecious Food
It's is really useful
Need a number to call
"I cancelled an order a month ago and when i used the card option for the first time, they deducted money for the cancelled orderand the current order. I want my money back as this happened yesterday"
It's a very useful and convenient app.
"Asta ahorita todo bien, Pedi comida china y pizza y todo super Rapido caliente y rico."
dowloaded uber eats more than twice still unable to create my account.. it's not going to nxt procedure after enterin my number.. Really felt bad one of the leadin online food delivery app is not updated properly for the customers
ABSOLUTELY RUBBISH ALLOCATION I CAN'T REGISTER!!! I'M FIRST TIME USER AND IT'S ASKING ME FOR A PASSWORD! IDIOTS!!!!
Why this app is still on Play store?
Great
good day sir /mad. I was just excited to have food this quick I am happy with app i used but later My mail is being blocked because of one of stupid guy for reported about it he didn't rech the place it was a rainy evening GPS not working well sometime he araibet next street when I was trying to talk to him about problems he started setty voice threatening to going back because of arrogant driver Uber eat not gonna succeed that much how they get job don't have idea please somebody can help
Awesome service!!
"Terrible customer service!! Even though it took over an hour my order to still NEVER get picked up I tried to change the address to my home addres instead of my job, my order was cancelled and I won't be refunded. When I brought up the fact that had I only called to complain about the extreme wait they said themselves I would be fully compensated. Then all they had to say was ""well you put the wrong address"". Never will I be forgiving for a long wait again!!!!!!!"
Map never shows location of driver and Delivery Tracker always behind when uber arrives with food.
I'm very disappointed with this app which I will be canceling my account or uninstalling this app I dont know why this uber app keeps charging me out of nowhere my bank balances always not where I know where left always on a pending charger with this app.... not happy at all..
Love it
Getting expensive! A couple weeks back one could order a burger and not break the bank. Now its 20 to 25 bucks for a 5$ burger.
Expensive with few options. Recently double charged but nobody can tell me why. They can only tell me it was authorized from my account. Can't reach a person by phone. Using a competitor in the future. Too many fees.
F****** amazing
Blank screed
The food always takes forever and it is cold. Multiple times I have waited hours and it never shows up. There are much better delivery options available.
Great service always friendly and packaged very well
"Easy to navigate & order. Great delivery drivers. I would like more restaurants added, seems to be a little limited."
They add a tip without your permsion and they take fees out of your account and dont explain them
Can cancel your order at anytime. Even when the food is a minute away. Calling them does nothing but give you a refund.
Excelente!
Been using this app a while and I'm not sure why. The fees are pretty steep and in my experience they don't like to bring utensils even when you hit the button. It seems they removed the delivery note section recently as well but that's not crucial I guess.
App has attitued. Used about 3-4 times had problems almost every time
Tried to sign up with my mobile number. It says I already have an account. So I enter my email it says wrong email. So I try the website same issues. There is no work around or option to create a new account.
"Same problem as the previous review, won't let me move past the address entry screen"
If they stuff up your order its hard to get a refund
Aweful I kept getting error messages and there's no way to contact a human being over the telephone unlike a competitor who I won't name
Comes in clutch
Easy and dependable. It's very easy to use even for someone who is not technology savvy. Thank you
Well last time i tried to use this i never got my order and still got charged for it even after i canceled it due to them not being able to get a driver thanks to the bartender at the place i ordered from i still got my meal but it was cold by then due to no drivers that evening
Uber eats is the worst. My order took over an hour. 3 people were listed to pick it up then kept cancelling the pick up. Meanwhile there is no option for cancel in the app or a damn phone number to call!!! So you sit and wait over an hour helplessly. I'd pick the damn order up but I cant cancel it!!! Then they charge a service fee and delivery fee. Ridiculous !!
"Well downloaded the app because had email saying, first time user would receive 20% up to 10$ off first order, uhggg that did not happen. 😤."
Good
"Very annoying that the app is giving me an invalid payment option against everyone of my cards, just because I am in travel. It took a token amount nicely enough but refuses to use the payment method for actual orders. Completely useless! And has let me down just when I need it!"
"The app is broken at the time of writing this. The reason it'll stay two stars for now is because contacting Uber to provide feedback of issues concerning the app is next to impossible and the main website offers no resolution. The email listed states ""You've contacted an email address that is not monitored, and so your request has not reached our support team."" I will not continue looking for how to provide feedback for your issue."
"Don't waste your time with this app.They will take your order and if it's not over $50 the drivers take it upon themselves to cancel and you're stuck in the lurch for almost an hour. No food, you can get your money back but you're back where you started + now you get the privilege of being hangry. Not a. Isolated incident either...3rd and final time!!"
uber os the worst app ever first you say my email isnt valid then you tell me its already registered you should fire your tech people because they clearly suck at there job you will never recive any of my money i hope you go out of buisness
"Absolute BULLSH*T tonight......my food was delivered to the wrong address, Uber Eats customer service is down, and the restaurant isn't answering my call!!!"
Great app
Easy to use
I brought uber cash and it wont let me use it so I'm not a fan
Good
👍
"Customer service is AWFUL. It's a joke. And when the app stopped identifying any restaurants, the customer service rep jaut read if a script about some ridiculous update they were making and to call back in an hour or two or send an email. When I asked what email address, again she read off a script that didn't mention any email address."
"Comecou com problema de endereço, não aparecia o meu corretamente, mas primeira vez que tive problemas com o pedido (faltou um item) e me senti totalmente desamparado. Não fornece contato direto e dá um prazo de 24h pra responder, uma afronta. Não irei mais utilizar o aplicativo, ficar alheio a passar fome quando a função principal do aplicativo era pra matar ela é o fim da picada."
Good so far. Got what we ordered.
"Great app!👍 Everytime I order from anywhere, it is accurate on time. Plus you get great promotions and discounts from time to time."
I only bought 2 times and it wont let me buy anything else
Very polite!
"I ordered 4big mac 3 fanta & 1 coke 11h45 5 March 2020 at Midrand they didn't ask me about payment options they just take money on my account , I didn't find my food and the message came as food delivered #22451 stop scamming people please enough is enough South Africa 😡 we all working hard for this money. Lena you just take it from our account lol."
É bom até o momento que você precisar de suporte. Me cobraram duas vezes pelo mesmo pedido já tem uma semana e não me reembolsaram.
Excellent service
Great app 👌
Why is McDonald's available like once in a full moon.. it's like a 5 minute drive away.. so frustrating
Easy app to use.. finally something delivered besides pizza.
"Deceptive pricing, they do not show you the booking fee any longer until your nearly done with order. The help tab appears to be outdated, the cancel option is not where the help tab says it should be. Customer support needs major work."
"Worst company and terrible customer service! I prefer Door Dash, I won't be using Uber anymore. My ordered was messed up and customer service gave false promises. Also, my address kept changing in the app. NEVER AGAIN!!"
I tried to delete my account and the link to delete my account doesnt work
Excelente service and very helpful if you are in a pinch.
it was amazing
I order food and my food did not come!!
Me encanta!!
Great job
What's up with the 'woke' ads?
"i ordered pizza, delivery guy said he dropped it abd i could get another one sent with the app. was very hard to contact uber eats through app, no response yet and no pizza."
Why is there no delivery to me
Just as unreliable as all the other apps when it comes to tracking your order's progress. It would be AWESOME if the drivers would underestimate the speed of delivery rather than overestimating it.
I have 13 in my wallet but it wont let me order i am so confused n hungry.
:D
I would give it a 0 if I could. No customer services and if a item of food is missing their solution is for you to tell them which item so they can make sure it never happens again.. not replace the item that you paid for.
Great!!
Can't get into my app
Great app for finding good food!!
So so
It's great!! But the fees make the whole purchase expensive.
"Their customer service is terribly ridiculous. When you call and detective your reason for calling the first thing they say is ""is there anything else that you need assistance with"".... didn't I just tell you, it's like their blatantly ignoring you. In addition my driver cancelled my order 2 HOURS AFTER I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR it. Uber customer service called me to apologize and instructed me to reorder and I would be refunded and when did and called they refused. They've lost me as a good cust."
I get promo emails that aren't easy to navigate to then the promo isn't even honored. They'll use all types of loopholes to not honor the promotions.
"Ordered delivery and a couple items were missing, went to try to report missing items and the app wouldn't allow me to,kept giving errors but everything else works. Sounds like they're just trying to scam"
Had no problems til my last order when my food was nasty & they refused to help me
I give it 3 stars because the service is really great but I'm sick of getting bicycles delivery during winter and receiving my food cold.
"The app would be better if the customer service aspect would improve. The app constantly goes down when you ask for a refund due to missing items. The delivery workers are polite. Unfortunately, restaurant staff and the internal app processes could use a lot of improvement. Until the refunding process is fixed, I do not recommend."
My experience was terrible I keep entering my email address and it keeps telling me that that's not my email address associated with my phone number I've been having the same email for 10 years and y'all need to take a shower system because I've been having the same phone number for 10 years fix your system or you want to be missing out on a lot of people downloading this app because your information is inaccurate
Fast and easy I like that
Canceled. And havent heard anything about a refund.
Item prices are more expensive that getting them in-store. Delivery men take their sweet time staying for 30 mims before finally moving. And missed order notes for almost every order.
"Until the company decides to fix the part of the app where you report missing items from your delivery, it can just go away. Three times now I've ordered from different places and parts were missing or messed up. I go into the app, go into help, try to report the missing or messed up order to get back the money that I spent on something I didn't get, only to have the app tell me that something went wrong. With no actual way to call them, I keep getting screwed out of my own money and I'm done"
So buggy my god
I ordered something for 3.95 and after I placed the order I saw its going to cost me 8.47 and I couldn't cancel it
"Useless App Mcdonald's in King Street, South Shields uses Uber Eats but I can't get anything as it doesn't find it and I live in Whiteleas, South Shields."
Wish there was more free delivery stuff if you order with someone like they do back in London
"Horrible service! I ordered something and some beverages in total I got charged 6$ for 2 drinks. These drinks were missing, I tried to report it but it said That something went wrong! They didn't give me a refund or send me the drinks."
Very good service. Nice delivery's
Ma commande est jamais arrivée. Le service client n'a jamais voulu me rembourser. Je ne recommande pas du tout !
It was great
"I first started using this app a year or so ago on my iPhone 8 Plus and NEVER had a problem! Just recently I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus and have had non stop problems with the Uber Eats app ever since installing it!! I constantly get an Internal Service Error, most of the time even though I'm logged into the app it won't show my saved payment methods owhen I try to place orders (especially at night) I'll get all the way to the Place Order screen and then the app will go haywire."
Will rate 5 stars if you guys fix me being able to register for rewards the link says error occured😢
"We just ordered a classic mc donalds with 3 sandwichs some fries and desserts but when we opened the bag ,we can't found any sandwichs .So like anyone , we gone on the help option to signal missing items and then we just have a sending error each time we try to send the report .Is this a joke? We are actually trying for more than an hour to get some help but the phone support is telling us to go back on application and application reports aren't working at all.Why is a report option down ???"
"Es la segunda vez que la usó, e me ha hecho un poco complicado porque hago pedidos grandes. Pero ya con el pedido listo el servicio es rápido"
Worst app ever it force me to log in into an account that I don't have the email address just usless
Horrible.
"Terrible customer service and courier provision. I'd suggest using another food delivery app rather than Ubereats or Just Eat since Ubereats and Just Eat allow you to make orders when couriers aren't available which leads to sometimes receiving your food cold or in some cases. Receiving your food at a point where you don't have time to eat it (alot of delays are the result of this problem, and they won't reimburse you since the company functions on investment capital, in case you were curious)"
The food God here really fast in the driver was very professional
"El código (70marzo) que me facilitan en el correo no vale. Lo introduzco y aparece como promoción disponible cuando hago el pedido, pero no se descuenta nada. He hecho un pedido superior a 15€ para probar y nada. Me dice que ya se ha solicitado el código. Muy mal. La última que uso la app."
Many times I ordered here.. says only max by 30mins. But infact It cost me 1hour and 20 mins... 3x I order there..it was only 12km away. But... this I think bad services they have
"Used to work fine, no longer works at all. Asks for address then says error fetching address. No other options on the screen."
Payment non explicite
"La mayoría de mis experiencias han sido buenas, excepto una a la cual jamás me dieron seguimiento."
Excellent
Tried on 2 phones and a laptop to order food to use the discount with no luck. It crashes every time. I'll stick to JustEat... It can't be that hard to make a site/app that works???
Cannot get into the app at all. Displays 'this email is already registered' message but has no option to login at all. Very frustrating!
"Troppo spesso capita che scelgo cosa ordinare, proseguo per pagare, e in ultimo mi viene comunicato che il ristorante è troppo lontano, e sono costretto ad annullare l'ordine. Inoltre l'app è piena di bug e risulta inferiore alla quelle della concorrenza. Too often it happens that, after I have chosen what to order, i am informed the delivery is not possible due to an eccesive distance from the restaurant. This is unacceptable and makes me waste my time. The app is poorly made overall."
"It's expensive, but its expensive to be lazy"
it keeps not loading the main screen the taxes on this service fee is too much.
"Thieves with zero customer support! We placed an order for a subway, with clear instructions to deliver. The driver text to say he was outside, we responded immediately (under 30 seconds) however by this stage he had left. He made no effort whatsoever to complete the delivery. We have tried to appeal the purchase after struggling to find anyway to contact uber however have heard nothing in response. The drivers and uber have worked out they can get away with this easily with no repercussions"
"First reviewed right at a year ago.... Nothing's changed. Still can't get delivery to my house and the app has been out for a long time now. I don't live very far out, maybe a 15 minute drive."
Good app. I love using it especially when I'm too lazy to leave the house
Absolutely useless do not use uber eats. If the delivery driver gives you the wrong food and drives off. Theres nothing you can do about it. Food you dont like and money down the pan
Fast affordable
"In 2018 I wrote a review based on other people's opinions and uninstalled the UberEats app. A couple of months later, I downloaded the app and started using it's services. I wish I had done so earlier and given the app a try rather than going off the thoughts of others. I have had no issues with the app itself. I love how I can see where my order is and track it until it's outside my home. It is just like Uber and allows me to rate my meals and the delivery person. Sorry UberEats. U r great!"
Good Ni
"Will not be using ever again they clearly cant employ people who understand how to deliver to a front door, because clearly standing at somebodys back garden gate for 20 MINUTES in the rain is clearly what you do. Food stone cold pure waste of 12 quid"
Will not update location and refuses to. Food stolen twice by driver customer service does not help.
"Bad experience , my order took more than 2 hours to deliver, I can't contact any customer service during or after the order,the food was cold due to the delay."
Exceptional
Stopped working the delivery address after I've entered it multiple times.
Uber eats is user friendly and convenience. Delivery rates are not overly priced and they're customer care is the best as they attend to your issues ASAP
Delivery fees are getting ridiculous it's just fees on top of fees
Very good
It's good but update the choices on some eateries. Some places have released new items but I can't order then because there is no option to e.g. KFC 80 popcorn chicken.
Brilliant
Uber eats work kyu nai kar raha hai. Install kar k login karo to start hota hi nai hai.
Best service
good.
very use full app
Really like kind of my least favourite app in my life right about now. Not the best user UX workflow especially moving between promo verification and checkout. Shows restaurants that aren't able to deliver and then denies you right at checkout. As if you don't want my money? How about you sort that right out?
Do not install uber eats india its now on zomato
It's a good app and service is awesome... So far.
"When you receive an incorrect order, there is no way to contact the driver, no response from the support line, nothing. Intentionally made impossible to solve any problems and you end up paying 3 times for what you received."
"Doest work, just does nothing when adding delivery address"
Very satisfied
Fast...
It's well put together and they go the extra mile it seems
Love the app and the people who delivers food makes the whole experience a lot better!!!
Just amazing
Great app! Fast food great tasting food. Very professional drivers !!! Always happy when order my food from this app !
"Great experience thus far, really enjoying the app drivers to this day have been very nice and kind and deliver the food on time"
Best out there...period
Easy and fast
They have a bad customer complaints platform and when they cancel your order they don't give you your promotion discount nor do they try to substitute your order.
good
"Ordered food by mistake, canceled the order but they still wanted me to pay for the food. Crappy app."
"Download door dash or GrubHub! Half the time it says delivery address is too far for order when just 24hrs prior I got food delivered to my house from the same place. The orders are wrong 25% of the time, the customer service is half decent, and it overall is just worse than the other delivery apps."
Fastest delivery in town
Great app. I love it
Fast and so many choices
Great app but also so frustrating! Sometimes parts of the app doesnt work and I am being constantly being told to try again later... well later I will not want my order any more so what is the point!
Nice
Amazing correct time delivery the food was very delicious delivery boy very kind with hers i like this app😁😁😁😁😁
If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered food and the delivery time kept getting pushed back and it would have been over a hour later when my food would have been delivered. When I canceled I was charged a fee. I canceled because they couldn't find someone to deliver in a timely manner and I had to pay the cost.
Gotta love IHOP...and just can't resist it
Amazing app. Food gets delivered very quick and the app is very easy to use.
Stupid apps
Good
Great app
"App experience is absolutely terrible. You can only chat to support via the notification on your phone once they respond. It's great until there is a problem, there are no contact options at all. Used several times with no issue but now switched to Just Eat."
"Why is there no option to change delivery address like with Uber cabs? And if there is an option, you guys have really hid it well..."
Everything is good
Just started using this app and trusted it but seems to have been shut down with 0 notice
Very disappointed about Uber eatd service. Today i put a order and after 2 hours they had cancelled the request.
Always fast and reliable. Never had a mistake with any orders thus far.
It used to be affordable but now even worth a $0 delivery fee they find ways to charge extra for everything. And for some reason 90% of your delivery drivers don't check receipts or deliver the drinks that were ordered with the food.
This app keeps giving me problems when I trying adding payment methods. I tried cash as well as card payment but it keeps showing an error message😏😏
I am trying to cancel an order. And there is no such option
Great food delivered to my door. I love it!
All good
Don't use! They take ur order even when there is drivers unavailable in your area and the restaurant makes your order and it is going bad. When u decide to cancel since delivery services are delayed waiting for driver? They take your money for the food and only reimburse the delivery fee. Don't use!!
Não tem como solicitar troco.
"Sometimes you literally cant order at all because they are too busy. So yeah, great app when you can actually use it."
Why your service is not available in nikunja?
I will change my star count once my orders are being ontime. Last few deliveries I've waited over an hour. Seriously thinking of going different delivery services
Great
Convenient.
Glitched out and now literally everything is unavailable. It does it alot
"No longer works with any orders. No matter what I try to order, it says my location is too far from the store, when the store is quite close. Yes, I know for a fact I'm ordering from the correct location."
"The update yesterday seems to have messed up the app. First it wouldn't go online, then I was able to load the cart but wasn't able to place my order, now there's just a server error. Totally crashed."
I ordered something and it never came. I hate this app.
Only works half the time
Satisfactory
"Not working, server error...location is too far... irritates a lot"
It's not working everything is showing unavailable
Good app
Always no delivery driver in my area.
I enter the app and all it says is 'we're not available right now. Please come back later.' Really starting to annoy me.
good
Really great service. Can't complain. I see that you have improved the app a lot.
Please come back

Amazing service
This is awesome..love it
satisfying
Good
Tasty
Fresh fast food wherever I am. I love this app.
Currently trying to place an order on my Galaxy s10 and the app will not let me delete a cc so that I can add the updated one.
Good app. but there is problem of selecting a delivery address.i suggest can you change that like map indicate with selection point it's easy for users
Excellent
Love it
Parts of my order was missing so was left disappointed
"alwasy error messages. ""your account doesn't have a password """
"Dude I got my food fast. Super fast, and it was soooo good!!"
Valid promo was not honored
Good
very efficient
App can be slow.
Best food delivery app in BD
Never left review before but had to as Uber eats are thieving scum I did not receive item they are refusing to refund me calling me a liar this crook of a company needs shutting down avoid at all cost
This app was very good and I am enjoying this app but I don't know why you will transfer my account to zomato. I don't like this app. Really this is not satisfied 😒.
Horrible customer service. Haven't received my order three times.
"Server error, was not able to place my order. Will not be using in future."
Good
Good
Easy to used i Love it
"I cancelled my order because the restaurant didnt have all the items but Uner eats didnt returned my $40 to my credi card. I contacted them next day to ask and they said it would be 10 days, a month later i followed up and they tell me i never comctacted them and it's too late. I did, but i shouldn't have had to in the first place, if the order was cancelled just refund me. Basically they just took my $40. Seriously how can you just keep my money?!"
Always seems to be something missing in my order.
Great App
"Works fine for the purpose. Not 5 stars because there are stuff that should be automated and shown to the user. For example if a courier is not available, after a period of time we should be able to cancel the order for a full refund in the app, instead of contacting the customer service."
I am using it for the first time and it is asking me for account password and email ..I don't know what to fill then how can I order ....worst
Good
"Works OK, but there should be a way to share menu items with other users, which would help in compiling group orders. Would also be helpful to see all nearby restaurants on a map, especially if they're within walking distance."
شكرا ل خدمتكم جميله
The app is not very easy to use sometimes it is frustrating and difficult and lags a little The selection of restaurants is good but it needs to add more restaurants that are found on other food ordering applications
I made my order I waited over an hour tried to cancel my order was unable to cancel my order when the pick up the order the map showed that he had not moved in over 5 minutes he had left the parking lot when I called the driver he asked which order I was and I told I had to leave the place I was at and didn't have time to wait any longer and that was at an hour and 45 minutes so I never received my food and ended up paying $15 for nothing
Tookover By Zomato!!! Do not download it.. It will not work...
Good and efficient
Excellent
Great drivers
This app is a scam i cant order any food 🚮🚮🚮🚮💔💔
Very bad unprofessional customer service.. Horrible experience 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Nice
It's really amazing I give it 5 stars
How to register on it its say me something's wrong several time. And i can't found any registration bar on it......😢
Why does it say you don't have a password? I'm not even logged in yet
Nice
Aid criminals I'm done
Bloody useless if you dont accept my sal Pac card°
No longer working Its asking me to download Swiggy app. Then no point in updating this app.. I stopped buying from app. Since the pricing structure is not like uber & menus are not easy like uber.
The awsum app
The food was really bad...there was no spice and no salt in it....
less offer
"A complete joke when it comes to customer service!! Order received Cold (not even warm) when you complain you get nothing but a standard message saying thanks for your feedback. And you don't see any negative feedback on the places you do order from. Complete Joke of a App & Service 05/03/2020 Reply from Uber is a joke, have been sending emails none stop and just get standard computer messages in reply. Uber just want your money and are not interested in customer service, or even good service."
"The number that you people have is from someone who had this number before me, so there for i dont know the password. You need to make an option where i can sign up DAMNIT!"
"The soup had one piece of squid, one piece of scallop, one prawn and 2 pieces of fish. It is way overpriced, especially when there are 0 vegetables in it. I put 2 stars because the rice was well cook ! I will not order from them anymore."
"Terrible service. Take on more deliverys then achievable. Had 3 different drivers try to get my food when I could clearly see they were waiting at another restaurant, as my food got cold and Uber support continued to ignore me. Never again."
Can't login
I don't want to use zomato....
Good app work for wat I need it to
Poor app and poor system service.
Sometimes won't let you order. Very convenient. Great for when in hospital.
Awesome
"I am trying to create a new account but at the last stage it’s saying support contract but in my process or related opening a account i have not got any mistake but always saying support contract, please suggest me how to solve this problem"
Pretty organized but how can I switch it to Arabic language ?!
All good here bro
"It's better if you can add a option like Save my favourite place. Coz then we can directly input from there,."
quick delivery.
Very briliant app
Gives option to edit menu items unlike deliveroo and just eat. Good refund policy.
The home page doesn't load ever lol. Smh
Every month they double charge and unless you complained they do nothing about it. This app sucks.
👍
No testy
"Terrible support, poor security controls, account was compromised and my requests were constantly knocked back by automated responses, forcing me to cancel credit cards and waste time. Recommend DoorDash instead."
Easy
First two orders randomly canceled after already waiting an hour
Good
Doesnt allow me to choose certain big chain fast food restaurants anymore. Which is highly inconvenient
Love it
"Been using this app for well over 3 years and some restaurants literally get the wrong order EVERYTIME and it turns into ab argument about who's to blame the restaurant or uber eats which is NONE of the clients concern, no matter how many complaints filed I haven't received a single call from Uber Eats, that itself says it all."
"Dodgy setup - allows the delivery person to just mark the order as completed without actually delivering. This does 3 things: prevents the customer from being able to contact the delivery person, prevents the restaurant from being able to contact the delivery person (called them), and takes your money yet you are left with no food and only the ability to leave the driver a bad rating and open a support ticket. Easy to get scammed. Would suggest sticking with deliveroo. *edit - uber refunded"
Sometimes just give up
"Promotions don't work. Buy 1 get 1 free didn't work: error, we are working on fixing it. I wrote an email to support and they told me I haven't used a special menu on the web page that did not work at the moment I ordered! I'd rather order from their competitors. Bye bye uber."
"Guys I'm missing this app a lot it was the best it was ""for the people app"" Zomato is just increasing the taxes as much as they like really not worthy #justiceforubereation's"
"Good app, shame the Mcdonalds staff can't read and count, yet again"
User friendly and fast
Unable to use my debit cards and no help with fixing the issue. Regular user and now stuck with taxis.
Always on time and good food quality
Why I am blocked?my numbers are blocked on your app I guess I an not worth using your app
Nice and easy
Not working
Fast and easy delivery great service!
"Hard to use, always showing useless things"
I hate that your company is not customer friendly. I had an issue with an order & I looked all over the app & could not find a phone number so I can call and talk to someone. Call me traditional but I like to actually speak to a person and not have to message your company. I accidently tipped the terrible driver & had no way of reversing the transaction. You need to put a customer service department in place! If other large corporations put one in place then you all should be able to as well.
Can't even register. Says your account doesn't have a password when I enter my mobile number to register.
Horrible irresponsables y no les importa el cliente
App keeps getting address wrong
Best app ever.. Easy to handling and if we have any issues with the order they response immediately and give the solution ..best in user friendly service ..
Uber eats lahore me kb launch ho rhe hy kb st work krna shoro kr rhe hy plz bta skty hy
"Orderd food in my area . After an hour it was still preparing, never found a driver. But cancelation charge had a driver tip. What driver? Ubers cancelation fees are made up bs. use door dash.(mcdonalds order btw)"
I ordered food at 10:30pm said it was preparing then a delay. Said iui t will be there at 12:10am. Check the app again said they were unavailable. Took my money. Horrible
Convinient easy to use all can say so happy🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👌everything perfect
"Horrible delivery time in my area, 2 hour wait!!"
Heaven
Amazing
I ordered 36 dollars worth of applebees an got a small fry from mcdonalds
Great app
"I wish there was a zero star option. Terrible, terrible interface that hides critical information about the location of a restaurant. Edit: I ordered pickup from a restaurant but the app by default doesn't show the complete address. It had the word ""Midtown..."" and hid the rest of the restaurant name. Turns out there's another restaurant in Midtown with the same name. Had to go to the other side of town to pick up what should've been just a few blocks away"
Good app
won't allow me to log in
There is no option of upi and wallet payment please add it.
Fees on fees
My only complaint is one order never showed up because it was canceled. They are usually good about getting stuff to you on time.
Still gaining experience with app but so far so good 👌
"Efficient, supportive staff at back end im pretty satisfied"
Why am I forced to tip?
You cant cancel an order u made
Great app and a Lifesaver
Good
Exceptional Service
If i could give a 0 i would i ordered food at 8pm i was told 40-50 mins that went to 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours im still waiting its after 10pm this is rediculous and most definitely bad business ... On the site u cant get any help and then they send 0 fee delivery for next 2 orders IF u use within 14 days its in sane ....
"What I want, when I want! They deliver quick and efficiently! Drivers have been friendly and courteous."
Didn't tell that Zomato has acquired it until I have downloaded Shame on Uber for these kind of cheap stunts Please mention here itself (during) download that it has been acquired by Zomato
awesome
Good
Buena
The driver always has to call me to find my house. Maps are not great.
Great!
🥂🥂
"Great app, tempts me too much to get food delivered!"
great!
Never had any issues....great service...drivers keep up the good work....
"Stay away. App has bugs (didn't apply my coupons for example) and on my first purchase the order came completely wrong. Not sure if restaurant or Uber fault, but in any case Uber tried to compensate with a 5$ discount (the food I paid for was worth more than that), even though I sent pictures of the wrong order as per request. I'd call it awful service and felt pretty scammed. Don't take me wrong, I'm a regular user of Uber, but Uber Eats does have a pretty bad consumer service and app ain't great. I'll stick to skipthedishes, never had trouble with."
Excellent
"Overall good experience, could have set choices for condiments when order Popeyes, don't see condiments no where"
It needs more selection
Very good 👍😊 will order again
Great Experience
Ubereats is my go to.
Terrible
Excellent
cooool
Never brings the stuff you need like ketchup or fork. Im very disappointed.
It's easy I like easy !
Won't accept my card with money on it😡
Its Horrible!!!!
very good
They delivered to thw wrong address
Terrible
"I love it , I'm handicapped & it's very convenient for me"
Como que vocês me dão um cupom e não me deixam usar? Fica dizendo que o cupom já foi utilizado mas está me cobrando o valor total do pedido.
"Worst app,they just need your personal data nothing else,"
This app has less options than DoorDash literally. Even if you'd like to look up another place it doesn't have it. It unfortunately meets my expectations since I was expecting to not see many options to chose from. I'd rather use DoorDash.
Fast efficient. The only wsy to eat. Great way to protect yourselves from the Corona virus too.
"The app now never properly updates when I driver is attempting to pick up your order. It used to work well, but now it's a buggy mess. Your delivery will be delayed continually during the ""picking up from restaurant"" step. Also sometimes drivers will switch three different times and the person who delivers your food isn't who is depicted in app."
Not very happy with uber eats or rides
It doesnt work!!!!! It keeps saying my cards dont work when ive used them before to order and there is money in there... it super frustrating even when i add them back in. Honestly useless
Portion size very small much over priced
Good!
"Prático, cheio de ofertinhas pra ajudar agente a se viciar rsrsrs recomendo."
It was food
I have had trouble the last three day trying to order food. The app keeps saying error fetching information.
Now the app finally got a update and now you cant see info on location of establishment to see and make sure the loaction of the place is the one you want. Please fix this as if i choose lets say kfc how will i know which kfc is the one i want becuase now u cant look at location information. Before we use to even be able to call location to confirm before purchasing on uber eats and now we cant.
New update broke it y'all. Just wanted to pass along. It does not work right now.
"You NEVER deliver to the correct address, rather you send your driver to the townhouse complex a block away."
"Gorgeus app!!!! easier and helpful, I can buy my favorite pizzzza from my house without calling and it has the same attention as a call! Good job Uber!!"
Great
Best ever
"As formas de contato antes de entrega é apenas por um 0800 , sendo nao possivel realizar ligaçoes de celular, o que torna impossivel qualquer mudança no pedido e o restaurante nao possui qualquer açao sobre, o IFOOD se sai melhor"
Delivery feed are too high
Customer Service is great.. any problems that arise with your order they fix & credit your account.. same with refunds to your debit/credit accounts. May experience some long wait times for orders to arrive sometimes but not usually.. Convenient service for people who may not be able to go to the fast food restaurant or dine in a restaurant.
Wp
Mah fat self thanks this app
very happy with the app although it would be great to have to be able to change delivery address when you are checking over your order. My work and home address still have same restaurant options but are still seperate areas.
"Um entregador não conseguiu achar meu endereço(que sempre peço em outros apps), cancelou o pedido que estava pago no cartão e não recebi estorno."
Called to change my address within 5 minutes of placing my order as I was at work and I usually order from home. I was charged the total amount without even a partial refund as the reason was the restaurant started preparing the order. For a customer to pay in full after trying to change the address less than 5 minutes of order is not a fair and good practice. Especially since no order is being delivered. Deleting the app and not using uber again.
Best food app period!
Efficient
It's good bra . Get the Wesley out
"They list restaurants that aren't active yet, take your money, then cxl your order without any explanation! Good luck trying to contact anyone, no contact info or complaint Dept listed on website! Shady!!!! Refund my money!"
Great
Very bad late delivery service
Very much helpful when you're hungry and dont wanna cook! Many options to choose from.
Just Amazing
I LOVE THIS APP ITS NEVER FAILED ME AND THE DRIVERS ALWAYS DELIVER FOR ME TO MY ROOM SINCE I CANT GO DOWNSTAIRS FAST ENOUGH IM HANDICAPPED THANK YOU UBER EATS
Good app
love it! Although the fees are high
"Terrible customer service. I often feel cheated out of my money when my food is burnt, wrong, ect. Uber asks me to upload a pic just to refuse refunds. Also hot food is delivered in cold days by bike delivery and there's no way to change it. By the time someone rides a bike for 10 min with your food in 30 degree weather, it's cold when it gets to you. Nevertheless, uber does not see this as a problem. I could go on and on..."
Good customer service
Great easy to use. Many many options
Awesome and very helpful
Good
Excellent service!
Excellent
It gets the job done.
Love this as a disabled senior so convenient
Food was delivered hot and driver very courteous will use uber eats again
It keeps telling me to put in an address then says it can't find an address.i can't do nothing else.this is the first and only thing that pops up when i open up the app.i never had issues with it before.what the hell is going on?
Good but expensive should have a reward system or something
Best way to order in. Love it
"Sinceramente, o app funciona bem, mas o fato de apenas 10% dos códigos promocionais que recebemos por SMS funcionarem fazem com que a experiência final seja péssima. Se for pra mandar códigos, me deixem usá-los pelo menos."
Awesome app full of variety 👌
"I wanted to like this service and I've used it several times but time and time again I will get a driver that is so incompetent, it ruins the experience. Today was the straw that broke me. Driver refused to deliver food to my workplace and then left with food. What always burned me up is that you are asked to tip prior to receiving the food and I would give a tip larger than what the app suggested in hopes it would translate to better service. Alas, it does not."
"Can't even register because it says my email is already in use, but never signed up for UBER"
"This app used to SHOW THE CAR thats picking up and delivering your food on the GPS, but now it doesnt anymore for some odd reason. It only shows the estimated arrival time and i have to guess where the car is. Idk if its a bug or glitch but can yall fix this??"
"I disappointed your app , because your app gave error when i searching order without place order, it's own gone order food ,then I paid that food ,what I need I didn't get and when i complaint your helpline they said they can't help ,so what use for help line nomber, because of that i degrade your star 1"
"A pior experiência que já tive com algum app desde que uso smartphones! Após todas as ladainhas de verificação, finalmente pude fazer meu primeiro pedido. Mas quando confirmei o pedido simplesmente recebi uma mensagem que ""meu número de celular não era permitido""! Já na configuração de conta diz que meu número está verificado! Tentei trocar a forma de pagamento para cartão de débito e recebi a mesma mensagem de erro, e agora não posso apagar nem os dados do cartão. E falta opção de limpar pedido"
my very first order was ENTIRELY wrong.
if I could I will rate zero start. I couldnt contact the driver and waited outside for so long. But she just left and told me its already 8mins and my order was cancelled without refund.
Won't let me add my Mastercard!
The support team experience is great. Twice my orders back to back were screwed up and they amended the situation right away.
Experience was horrible he delivered my food to the neighbor across the street amd diagonal from where I live.... he needs to look at house numbers... I'm not happy... I had to go on a scavenger hunt for my food.... NOT HAPPY!!!!!!
Fast nice food good service love it
The best App. The only bad is the pricess of the restaurant to much
I cant remember a single time everything went right with this service.
The app keeps giving errors
Good service great deals
A experiência com a Uber eats Portugal é horrível. Vou desinstalar a APP é a última encomenda que faço. Aprendam qualquer coisa com a Glovo..se não tivessem exclusividade com alguns restaurantes tinham 0 clientes
Really good app easy to use
Well over priced rather go get it myself alot cheaper
App keep on crashing trash uber eats
Good job 🤩❤️
LOVE THIS APP but very hard to get in contact with customers services
Esta app es super mala no me dejo verificar con mi cuenta de Facebook y me hizo verificar con la tarjeta cuando solo queria pagar en efectivo
good
So far
Great app depending on your area
Great
Missing items Dips not in for nuggets
I like the delivery service but it's getting a little too expensive.
Very DISAPPOINTED. Last Saturday I order food. For my kid and I. Got the wrong order which is very common. Not sure why. Anyways the company or restaurant doesnt hesitate to take your money but they have issues refunding your money right away. Feels like I'm the one being punished having to wait nearly a week to get my money back. I believe this company policy shouldn't apply to situations like this. If they mess up they need to give the money back right away. I didn't even eat the wrong order!
"Uber account I cannot login, my mobile number is 055********...its beens years i didnt used it. I go to forget password but then i forgot the registered email address which i dont even use it. I cannot also make a new account with the same number....but i want to badly use uber eats. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you."
Server Error message keeps showing...app will no longer work...
"Excelente servicio, eficiente"
Constant server error
Good service
Great App
Driver arrived in good time and food arrived hot for once !
"So glitchy. Just went to place an order it told me I lived too far when I've used the app before, then it kept saying internal error and now the place is unavailable."
Internal server error after spending ages choosing my order
I am happy that they deliver from Sonny's BBQ. Because they are the only ones. To do that
bad application
Waited while I watched driver do another delivery. My food arrived stone cold.
No contact numbers now more than hour and nothing arrive☹
Arrrived at time
king
"VERY VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED!! I've ordered from them a couple of times and it's been 2 TIMES that they took 20$ of my debit card and 1 TIME 7$ when I used their 20$ rebaits for INVITING A FRIEND. They have taken 47$ of my account and gave me back 20$. THAT IS MORE THAN UNFAIR. Because I have to pay full price for my food of course but when ""they=million dollar companie"" make a mistake THEY DONT DO NOTHING. I'LL BE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE AND MY MONEY, PLEASE. We will see if I get some help."
Excellent
"Customer service gets 1star they don't properly read your complaints and clearly don't have a good grasp of the English language. I've never seen such a lack of ability to understand basic instructions. I was trying to update a new payment instruction and two staff thought I was trying to change my delivery address! 🤔 4/3/2020 Edit: I ordered a McDonald's and they tried sending three different drivers to collect it, by the time I received my meal it was cold and Uber won't refund the cost."
"The app doesnt allow to make a payment. Then you cant delete the payment option, as it is suggested? Cant pay, can eat??"
Best ever!
"Desrespeitoso com os clientes. Pedi para o endereço errado, mas segui as orientações do aplicativo para resolver a situação. A orientação era ligar para o entregador e dizer o endereço correto. Fiz isso, porém o entregador tava de bike e não pudia ir em casa. Foi ai que me ligaram de SP dizendo que o meu pedido ia ser cancelado e que eu teria pagar o seu valor integral. Eu reclamei dizendo que o aplicativo não falava dessa possibilidade e o suporte disse ""não importa o que o aplicativo diz"" 👏👍"
Good
Great! They rock!
Good
Stole my money and threatened me for asking for help
They never do deals in my area which really sucks deliveroo always do deals which is why I prefer that really debating getting rid of my account as it's just the same rubbish all the time
100% Perfect
"Worse experience ordering ever. After speaking to the call centre ""manager whom have 0 understanding or courtesy to understand the issue. Deleting this APP right away....."
Good
Dope
Need more promotional offers
Fast food and delivery is cheeper
Exceptional
Yall charge me for weird things and sometimes twice for the same order and I dont get any kind of refund soooooo like 3 stars is generous. I usually use Doordash they're better.
Probably one of the worst apps that does not work. Had to get of my couch to go and get food but also lost out on promo. Come on guys !
First time ordering today. Order was wrong. No response from Uber eats after I immediately notified them on app when I got my food. Sent proof And no response. Bad customer service never got any response. Update: my bank account shows I was charged for the whole food order when I had missing items. App says I was given discount but it's a lie. GrubHub is the best food delivery so far even though you pay more it's not a headache.
Satisfied
Would love to see Mc Donald's and Nandos and similar restuarants . Specials also don't show.
The deliver guy was quick can't fault. The app was hard work first telling me that they couldn't deliver. Then i quit the app to then get a text to say that he's on his way i was very confused.
Worst experience
Very good customer service from the company
Really fast
Does not accept my card payment
I cant cancel the order or change it after i order it
Convenient
Excellent and quick. I did a little experiment between Uber Eats and Doordash to see which one was more expensive. I compared the same restaurant (Popeyes in this case) and gave a 4$ tip on both apps and found Doordash to be several dollars more with the same items and it has a longer delivery time. Not a jab at Doordash just a comparison. Would highly recommend Uber Eats if you cannot get out of work for lunch.
vehicles problem
The app is crashing all the time
Scam alert: Uber eats SA hires thieves who steal our food and when you take it up with Uber they tell you they can't assist you with your issue and that you won't get a refund. My food never arrived and I logged a complaint only for Uber to tell me that I've made a complaint previously and that my activities are suspicious and that my account will be taken down. I took the liberty to do it for them. I deleted my account and I highly recommend for anyone to not waste their time.
"App can't locate the exact location, You can't even find your location or set it by yourself. The delivery man don't use internet too. They take your money and don't even give your food. ""Missing items"". If you report the issue, the customs don't even sort it out too..."
Good
"Awful, the user experience is dismal"
Nice
"Don't get it... Can't even see like restaurants or anything just a map that says ""coming soon not their jet....."""
It's taken me a while to warm up to Uber eats but now it's my go to App
So convenient and eady to use.
Sucks after zomato added
Okay
Ok
Terrible! I'm trying to install for over 6 months and it's always the same. When I give my phone number they ask for the password and as I dont remember cause I've been using deliveroo instead of this. they say my password is wrong and also my email is wrong. And they simply dont give you any contact for customer service or other way to try to provide help. you just get locked out! So I simply cant acess and there's no one to help or Log in with social media or anything
Amazing. Regular user
Efficient
Thorough and convenient
I cant make checkout and when I logged out I couldn't login again
bang on for me pukkoh scrans mate KFC subway maccies d lot mate
Had an issue with my order. Uber refused to help out in anyway
Disappointing really bad didn't recive food and still zero answer from them my issue was not resolved
Love Uber eats
I swear all my orders show up cold or have a bad taste these days. I'll change my review when I get real support on the issue.
For me its a nice to have Uver eats app...👍
Server error on payment method.
"Lags, and crashes"
Very helpful
"""Your account does not have a password"" :/ Having this issue since eternity. Dumb devs. UPDATE: Resetting password resolved the issue, but I cannot set my password as the old password :/ :/"
المنيو لنفس المطعم أغلى من منيو المطعم نفسه ايه اللي يخليني استخدمه
Not coming fast
Great
"Disappointing, my order never came"
I cant order anything. This app doesnt work. (Continued) The app flat out will not load properly. As soon as you get to a restraunt and try to dmstart ordering it just glitches and kicks you back out to the main page. It did this over and over again until i finally gave up and used another app.
Good site but delivery a bit expensive. And wolviston mcdonalds no drivers turn up
No me deja ingresar la dirección
Fast service friendly drivers
"Ordered £20 of food from a burger chain, when it turned up over £7 of it was missing. Took over 9 hours to hear back from customer services! Fine that you refunded the missing items but if I wanted to reorder them I'd have to pay another £3.50 delivery. You could easily have rung the shop & got them to send it out there and then. Also getting someone on a bicycle to deliver meals with hot coffee in isn't a good idea is it? Half of mine was soaked into the drinks holder."
Good
Love the app
Gd
Waited forever to confirm my so called account. No customer service available. So disappointment
Used to be the best app for food delivery in India but.......
"Fantastic app. Order food, food comes to your door. Can't get much simpler than that"
The driver didn't give us a change.
Very goos she twice eat
Don't know why it get sells
Really
"Polished interface, and flexible payment options."
Got my free delivery cause I'm fat <3
خدمة عملاء سيئة
Very poor
There must be telephone contact with customer service
Really good app to use
Enjoying the App
Great app and fast delivery.
Lots of things wrong but the app administrator helped fix issue thank you
Love fresh delivered food. If i didnt. I wouldnt use this app. 5 stars
Sadly this was great at first but recently it's been literally useless as no addresses pop up as soon as I start to type mine in. I've tried messing with it to see if perhaps it was my address but it wouldn't work with anything. Sadly disappointed I couldn't get any use of this anymore.
Easy to use
Excellent App... but cannot cancel the order
Good
Excellent
Best services
As usual.
"Stupid app, didn't accept my payment method. I tried to add mastercard, PayPal"
Very bad experience
Great but my location is always inaccurate which confuses drivers
I downloaded this app. When i was about to check the restaurants it says you have to install zomato further. Then whats the use of this if i have to install zomato for ordering.
"Normally works well, has messed up on me when i placed a order, nothing showed, then after resetting the app sends TWO orders, then to add insult to injury tell me they can cancel but not refund my order"
Great and convenient.
Best delivery app
Really seamless
Great app for getting food delivered highly recommended!!
"It's bad enough to have such a great platform and not being able to cover all zones, but to have some already covered and your services run in those areas and then remove them and not operate there anymore, that's even worse! Stop sending msgs about your lousy offers on your lousy selection of restaurants while you already removed the area I live in from your precious covered zones."
Perfect app
good
"Great, however no rewards for people who use this app all the time"
Delivery was quick so cant complain at that.. only i ordered a double sausage and egg mcmuffin but received a single sausage and egg mcmuffin.
Great app
My experience was the driver didn't try I was trying to tell him but that's okay I will try again
Excellent
"I can't able to login, Error showing as --> Your account does not have a password."
"Easy to use , Simple and Friendly"
Fast and efficient
The app doesn't allow the user to save and see the comments they may leave about the service providers. The developers should also allow the user to save notes and comments about the service providers for future references.
"This app is so user friendly. It would be great if it used location data better instead of assuming that you are still at your previous location. It would also be great if it would provide tax invoices rather than sub-par receipts. Other than that, it's fantastic."
It's useless. I have verified my account and everything else but I still cannot order food because of I'm blocked but I'm a new user. I am not happy at all. I could give it 0 starts if I could
Awesome
Very effecient
Only some items delivered not good at all
Ordered food on sunday the 1st and payed 100 AED for a 81.00aed meal. Then got an email saying i had under payed and they wanted another 81.00 ead. The driver obviously took the money for himself
"Expect overpricing. Expect big ""delays"". (Hour and a half after my last order, they just updated the delivery time to another 30 minutes. Can't cancel without paying for nothing.) If these weren't common issues, I'd vent within their customer service. But it has gotten kind of ridiculous."
"Attempted to cancel an order to Popeyes immediately due to an incorrect delivery address to a whole different city & state. This fast food was not picked up yet and probably not even prepped either, but Uber Eats will not cancel the transaction. They still charged me for unprepared, untaken, and undelivered goods. Very scam-like! Just horrible! Overseas customer service rep very irritatingly would thank me ""very much"" after every statement I made too, which only aggravated the situation."
"So you make an order, you wait 45 mins, they send it to the wrong person, then Uber calls you to say that the order has to be cancelled, rather than having the restaurant make the meal again and send it. I don't understand. This is Uber service?"
Choice
"Can't order anything. Uber constantly needs me to varify my account. When I click on ""verify"", it just closes my order"
Superb..... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Super
good service
What the .......!!!! If uber is aquired by zomato ...what is the use of downloading this app???shittt..it would have redirect to download zomato app itself...waste of time
Awesome promo and by all accounts appears to be as advertised. Referred a friend and received $20 off my next order. In the end my ensuing order cost me $.29
😉 😘
They have transferred to zomato the need of this app is not required in play store
40 min late never Uber Eats again
very good
"Very very poor I waited and waited and waited for my food order and went way past delivery time, i called the restaurant and they said my order was made and still sitting up there waiting for the driver to pick it up and then later got a text saying my food order was cancelled i had to figure something else out for dinner for my family im very displeased and very UNsatisfied."
Good
Y dont you expand your delivery area?
I can be lazy and this is perfect when i am
Bad service. Can't cancel orders. Don’t show delivery man's number to communicate
Had problems with app crashing alot but it's working good now
Can't even sign up 🤦🏼‍♀️
You get food. At your home. Costs money. Food app. Good.
"On point so far, no disappointments experienced. Just wish it can be available to other places soon"
"Automatic ala-carte? No condiments? Service fee ? for what? Delivery fee ? Its a delivery delivery service. Whats the difference between delivery and service... Redundant. ...for answering the headset, just like the drive thru? Plus tip...??? Its across the street. You should charge for parking too... you know, while the driver is waiting for you to get the order wrong...? ...and take the blame? plus 35%tip ? ...gouging. ""You forgot the gravy...."" What do you charge for a ""HotPocket?"
👌
It's really convenient when people need it
"These app was not login to new account. Always asking( use your uber account to get started).. Suppose, I have my friends account. I dont remember password.. I saw the forgot password option.Asking email, I forgot my email.. What can I do??????? Suppose fix like do you have email or mobile number Not just an email..."
Amazing deals and services
I'm disappointed because in uber eats the only place I can get food delivered is 5km down the road I can't get mcds or lonestar
There's no way to speak with a customer representative. Only a small list of pre determined issues to choose from. Good luck figuring it out on your own if anything goes wrong.
Crazy
Best
The driver took to long wasnt in right car
best app...
Placed my first order and waited over an hour for it to be cancelled by UberEats. Uninstalling and going back to door dash and grub hub. Stay away.
Super quick and easy
Great app. Convenient and fast. Hope it'll cover more areas soon.
Extremely hard to find a help contact number
Works well
Its been 2 yrs and they yet to come to my area... waiter does ... so im done with ghis app... and Uber period.. if i could i would give zero stars
It worked
Fast.
They couldn't find a driver for an hour.
احسن تطبيق طلبات في عالم
Missing Uber eats. Zomato is pathetic in terms of pricing and offers. Ubereats was best.
Long registration only too find service not available here
You cant use your uber prepaid card for food . I put 200 to 500 a week on it for rides to work . Why do I have to put a prepaid card on it too to buy food . Should fix that . And I would never give my bank card or a credit card number with all my money on it the get scammed . Like I did from Lyft. at least you have the gift cards
Love you
"Took money out of my account without my consent ,i am very disappointed and its only my first order, and we don't want those uber eat pass , why would you deduct that amount whereas i didn't agree, Please don't create an Account with Uber Eats if you want peace. Take it from me they've deducted funds from my account two times without my consent and wow I'm broke"
", zzz,"
They need to make it where you can customize your order. I couldn't even choose what kind of drink I wanted or what I wanted or didn't want on my sandwich. We ordered from Whataburger not sure if it's like this on all the restaurants.
Have had nothing but drama since I updated my credit card this app needs serious bug fixes
Hevi ചാർജ്
gr8 app
Will cancel your order if you dont notice the door. What is the point of even ordering from you guys if you cancel and charge? If you are charging anyways why would you not leave the food? Wasteful and shameful conduct. Taking advantage of customers. Will not be using again or recommending to anyone.
Deleting this app! I've absolutely had it. I picked a restaurant that had a free delivery because it's close by and I'm sharing the delivery with other orders. My meal was 14 dollars. Then they hit me with a a 2 dollar service fee and a 3 dollar small delivery fee. WTH?! I ordered a meal and a soda and soup. Small delivery fee?! After tax and tip and fees my meal was 23 dollars. Ridiculous. Uber is a joke. I'm switching to lyft and door dash! Bye!
I waited a whole hour for my food to get delivered just for it to be cancelled.
"It works very well, except I cant remove my payment methods and unfortunately it declines my card even when I have money on it."
Totally annoyed. Got an email about free delivery....started to get everyone's order in and by the time I was about to hit enter...it said the deal was over. It was literally a count down. Why would you think anyone would come back or order after that. I went to door dash and ordered. UPDATE ...so you answer me and you obviously did not read my complaint otherwise you would know that I understand how it works but you offered FREE delivery but once I got my order together it said it expired.
This very very poor aps
Great
You guys have been sucking fo the past 2 months. I'm done with you.
Just checked my bank and I have been charged on four separate days for one delivery ...all four were different amounts ...I ordered a half chicken dinner for my son and total charge is now 125.. how is this possible that four different amounts. On four different days are charged for one order
"Cool app, needs to see people's reviews though"
I only used it a little but it did the job each time. Order food and they deliver it. Nothing to complain about besides prices but that's not relevant to the app.
So far it's been good
A lot of great restaurants around here within 2 miles that aren't included as options. There definitely needs to be more variety available especially when there are not so great restaurants that are over 4 and 5 miles listed. It just doesn't make sense to me. Also as I'm scrolling through the app I see the same restaurants 2 or 3 times. What's the point of this??...Unfortunately as a result I've been using Door Dash much more although their delivery drivers aren't that great.
Very easy and saved me when I forgot my wallet at home when I was at work luckily it transferred my stuff from Uber to Uber eats and I didn't have to go without food on a 11hour work day with a long travel home
Excellent
同じ店でも配達できる場合とできない場合があるなど、ロジックが意味不明。
Exception service hands down.
Update
Use any other app.
Simply heaven. Perfect for those days you remembered that there is no food at home and you need to chow down.
Heavens forbid you forget to change your address because they will not let you change anything. Update your system and let us make adjustments. I had to leave work to go to my old address to get my food. Smdh!
I am consistently satsfied with food and delivery.
Awful!!!!! Didnt follow ANY delivery instructions and cancelled my order!!! Then i try to call Uber and of course cant reach anyone
Great service and drivers are so nice
Todays food took too from McDonalds horrible cold and soggy
Best Buy sales stove.
Good app to ask for food
"After multiple orders being cold upon arrival and no refunds, DoorDash reigns supreme."
Good
It is useful for all eating dinner
"There is no way to customize Items on the Taco Bell menu, WHY?"
"Tive um problema hoje com um pedido, tentei o dia todo suporte mas literalmente cag@r@m. Uma bost@"
App works well Good tracking system Seems to be too many fees that add up quickly For only one person's meal
For the last 3 weeks your map doesnt work anymore. Before that was great now the app sucks
"My entire order was wrong, and I haven't eaten all day so I'm pissed"
HORRIBLE I've made an order from Uber Eats and recieved an order for a lady named Beth and have the recipes and UBER EATS is not refunding me and threatening to close my account. Mind u after this I am officially done with UBER EATS. They steal money from you and won't pay it back.
Extremely slow. Terrible app developers.
Who doesn't know Uber Eats is fuego? Seriously.
Overall an excellent application.
The app has not been updating the map with the information about where the driver is. Keeps saying driving is in the same spot for 30 mins even though he was outside my house. I've closed the app and refreshed it 5 times and still does not update.
Worked fine. Until it started gaving me payment error messages then when I had all the correct details. Happened on multiple occasions. Otherwise nice app. But don't use it anymore. Other similar app works fine.
Most deliveries have been on time. And food has been correct. They also credit you a promotion if your food is late. Which my only complaint is the promotions expire. I use
"This app is crazy! I tried to order from MacDonald, I went to checkout & order was no longer available so I went back to menu to order alternative then a message came up saying order is on its way, but that was just the food so went back to menu and ordered the drink, Only thing was the previous order separate drivers one with drinks one with food and no option to cancel the new drink order. So I paid £11 on delivery 🤔😟😠😡 long delay between ordering and confirmation. Uncertainty on orders"
Always great service and choices for Fleming Island..Thank you🍕🍨🍽🍔🌮
"Horrible support! I called the support line and they were totally useless! My order was missing a complete order and the UBER driver was told by someone at UBER that they could not go and get the order that was missed. I called to get help and no one cared! I have removed my UBER EATS app. This is the third time the driver didn't double check to make sure the order was complete! Not worth it! Maybe it will be complete or maybe not! Don't call because no one cares and now I have to scrambled for dinner, which is crazy because I ordered so I didn't have to cook!! *There is nothing more to add!"
Awesome
"Una estafa total está aplicación. No la recomiendo en absoluto. El fin de semana pasado pedí una pizza y el REPARTIDOR me canceló la orden, luego soporte me llamó y me dijo que hubo un problema con el restaurante y que mi dinero sería reembolsado. Pasaron días y se me cobraron de mi tarjeta 14 dólares, y a pesar de enviar fotos y pruebas de que se me realizó el cobro, el soporte de uber solo atinó a responderme el mismo mensaje ""el cobro no se le ha realizado"" sin devolverme nada"
They are awesome !!!!!!
Love this app
Still did not receive my order
"They should bump off delivery drivers who select to pick up the food, but clearly are running other errands (more than an hour) before they even pick up the food"
The delivery order was good but I thought i put an order in for an fish fillet meal ..thamls anywau
Awesome love it 👌 5*****
The app seems very clunky and odd when it comes to fluid navigation. The user interface looks bland now with the newest update and it's taking forever for me to process my order. I don't understand what's going on here....something's off.
This app is good
"No problems with app ever!! Just restaurants not completing orders correctly, not Ubers fault."
Had cancelled app before . Too many issues with drivers. Today I had my wrong food delivered. Getting tired of this
"Please add ridgeland and Hardeeville, SC"
Can't figure out to set up ac ount to pay for the fiid and cant find any help
"Sometimes its false advertising, about the food. Also food be extremely cold on delivery drop off . Over pricing, attitudes, sloppy delivery."
"Aplicativo dá promoção e não consigo confirmar meu pedido, fica dando erros."
Great
Pretty good
Taxes are Tuff but it's a good service.
First time eating from this place amazing thank god I love 10mins away . I'll buying from them again
Convenient
Got No Complaints About It
Never had a bad experience
Love the convenience and deals ❤️
Great service
Always a problem. Last night my uber eats driver basically stole my dinner!!!
Great
"Deliveroo is so much better - at least they don't charge you for food you did not receive. We just ordered, the delivery guys could not be bothered to check our instructions on the message, so they allegedly ""delivered"". No one rang our doorbell, no food made it to us. No way to contact the delivery guys whatsoever to even tell them they got the wrong address. What the hell. They even changed my account already. Never ever ever going to use that again!"
Love it!
Before the driver would call or text from an unknown number in case he or she was lost. That option no longer seems to be there. Why?
Quick and easy interface
"Funciona fatal, no deja volver a activar mi tarjeta de crédito para poder pagar, no hay forma directa de hablar con atención al cliente salvo que haya un problema en algún pedido, lo cual, por cierto, es bastante probable. Siempre tardan más del tiempo estimado, incluso viviendo en el centro de Madrid, y los restaurantes suelen equivocarse con las órdenes, lo cual creo que es intencional."
Great
🙌🙌👏👏👌
I ordered without mushrooms onion nd cheese but everything was available on my meal which i avoid
Dope life saver
All.on point
"Great app, simple UI and easy to use. Let you know exactly when your order will arrive, wich is great. Need dark mode."
EASIER WEN ON OWN SUMTIMES&TO POORLY 2 COOK 4 URSLF.WITH STANDIN&GETIN UP&DOWN 2 CHECK IT
Awesomeness
Amazing delivery fast and good And the order was perfect
Great.
Annoying when you order something at 12am. Says its gonna be there at 1:30am. Its 1:22am and then they call up and cancel the order. Then you order something at 6 and then cancel it again.
It's a shity app that never works properly! !!!
love it
Great deals
I was happy with the speed of service and the attitude of the customer service
Great
With any service you will have some bad experiences but for the most part I have had nothing but great experiences with the food and the deliver drivers who is always friendly
"Keeps double ordering my orders. I put an order it vanishes, no matter how many time i refresh app then i have to reorder then it charges me both times and sends me two orders its really annoying"
Am friendly
It's an useful app for all food lovers.
Recieved food so cold I had to throw it in the garbage and Uber did nothing to make it right. I can't believe I paid to have garbage delivered to me. Well never again.
"Awesome, just disappointed once when ordering food from chicken licken."
Woow
Wrong order
What's not to like?
"Al momento de pagar tu orden deberia mostrarte la dirección a la que estas mandando la orden, para checar fácilmente que tengas la dirección correxta seleccionada, siempre ordeno desde el trabajo o desde la casa, y a veces tengo que salir del processo de checkout para confirmar que tengo la dirección cirrecta seleccionada, agregar esto la pagina de checkout, sería más conveniente."
I cant apply my uber credits to the total? What's the point of the uber credits then?????
Update 3/3/2020: -Had an order cancelled on me by the driver. No explanation why nor response from support. STAY AWAU FROM APP. I usually used the app for late night food or weekend romps but started ordering lunch for work to be sure I eat more. I had an issue where 3 times I did not recieve my food.. the last time being the same woman who started this trend with my deliveries. Good for close orders or weekends but beware of food stealers.
Lovely Koni
А+++
First time using it and Jersey Mike's refused to take my order. Nice.
I'm getting really frustrated with these excuses this useless team has. Close shop I say! If it's not cold food then the app does not work properly then missing food items. They can't help with nothing at all.
My library
best best
Great app.. 💗💗💗
I have yet to have a bad experience with uber eats. Theres been a couple of time where I had to reach out to customer service and they have always been so helpful. Uber eats is my go to when I want take out.
"Too many fees for no reason and ""promos"" that never work"
Great app for truck drivers who cant get in town
"2nd time i ordered and had issue on order, i open ticket for 2nd time uber reject the ticket .. why? Becoz this is my 2nd ticket!!!!"
Love the convenience of this app!!
It was awful they got to my house in like 45 minutes and the food was cold
"Very bad I tried to do the promotion for 99 percent off,it said not eligible. Fix it, very bad app"
Great
Awesome app but ridiculous expensive.
Doesn't always update my delivery partner's progress that well
User warning app will change your address to a differnt one without users concent.
Me encanta las ordenes llegan a tiempo todo genial!!
Uber Eats is a great delivery service...but im always missing an item and constantly requesting a refund(restaurants fault)...Uber eats always refunds me without an issue and I really appreciate that...thank you Uber Eats!!
Worst delivery app I have used by a long mile.
Great delivery time!
"RIP Uber eats, but it's funny how this app even after taken over by zomato is demanding update. Guys come on; now Uber eats only redirects you to zomato!"
Skert boom pop
its easy to use but sometimes the prices are cheaper at the store and the chances of your order being wrong are very slim but there is a chance of it happening
"Hi, unhappy customer here, i order weekly, i ordered from Mcdonalds yesterday and submitted that i did not get an item from them (apple pie) as you can confirm the store had no stock.(the store has issues with stock as this is the second time they didn't have stock of an item) the response i got from you is that i cannot get a refund for the product that was missing? Stealing money from users and threatening to disable my account."
Over charged for order and double charged for a tip. Customer service says it's the app and not their fault. My receipt says one total my bank reflects a higher amount. Customer service again blames the app and makes the end user feel stupid. Never again.
The most enjoyable food app!!!
Good app most restaurants are available.
Very convenient for those who have no transportation and want fast food delivered to your house.
Lovin' it...it's so perfect
"They charge extra for each food item some by 3 or 4 dollars even. So you end up paying at least 10 dollars extra for a 1 person person meal not just the 2.99 for deliver or 2 bucks ""service fee"""
scam
Excellent service
Perfect
Hi uber eats.. I can not register with the app..when I type mail address they said you already registered.. And there is no other option for accessing the app. Hope you will rectify it. Thank you so much.
Useful.
Tracking never works
Uber eats doesnt delivery if your meal is below a certain price range n it always has excuses like update your billing payment when your method of paying is is very function and when they have promotion your order will never to proceed.🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️ Mr D is more reliable
So lately i have been ordering and every time i do my orders get cancels because there is no driver you need to fix that if you have no one to pick up orders then put it on there sorry no drivers
Good
Dont let u sign into ya account just asks for ya number then email to say theres already a account with that email
Sometimes takes to long to load
Fast
He doesn't know how will go by proper location.......his behaviour also not gd..then how we will feel safety at night in cab.....no never.....
"This is the third time one of my orders has been messed up. When I complained I received a refund of the food but as I said in my response, I would not have ordered food for my guests if I had known that 75% of my order would not come in. I had to go out to pick up food anyway so I told them I should be refunded the entire delivery and service fee and I have yet to receive a reply."
fake restaurants name
Is a good app
Excellent
Great app
Nice app!
Awesome
Really bad
This app will not download to my phone trying to find a Uber Eats so I can be a delivery driver keep saying that I already have an account and I don't
worked well
Good
Great food
"I got a completely different order and I kept calling customer service and they were not helpful. One woman named ""Hafsa"" I called the second time she was speaking to some other people and laughing whilst I was making my complaint and asked me to repeat my complaint all over again and then she said she'll get back to me and kept me on hold for around 15 minutes so I ended up cutting the line. I wasn't given a refund nothing. Make sure to give your customers refunds if ya'll mess up an order."
"Hello, im having difficulty using the app. It doesn't search for the location or i cant add a location."
Horrible experiences of food deliveries getting cancelled even after pickup from restaurant
Amazing
I've been having issues with the app. When I enter a delivery location I get an error.
Fine
I gained 10 pounds
"On delivery, the meal was very cold. Had to throw it away"
The app will force you to use a credit card just to use a gift card and if you contact customer service about it they blatantly ignore you. I have $25 in uber credits from an uber gift card that the app will not allow me to use without adding a credit card as a payment option. I have no desire to add a credit card just to try out a service I should be able to use with the gift card I already added to my account. When I asked for help they gave me a BS response saying to add a credit card.
"Whenever the restaurant has made a mistake, uber eats always finds a way to compensate for it"
You cant get refunds after they mess up. this is horrible
Good
Wasn't to sure about other people bringing my food but I've had nothing be good experience so I'll continue..
The worst and worst food deliver app ever after waiting for more than an hour the order automatically cancelled none of them are ready to pickup the food after every 10 minutes I received a different pickup man with their car details. Extremely disappointed with Uber eats.i never recommend any of my friends to use this app So far I'm getting best service from careem. They have a nice person who keep the value of the brand.
Superb
"Awful support for orders. The delivery guy was 2 min away, it said the order was completed and there was no way to contact anyone! Pathetic. Sure they refunded the money but after u wait for so long for ur order, that does not solve the issue. Horrible experience. Uninataled nad never going to use again."
It's a good app
ممتازه ك عروض لكن مفيش اي خدمة عملاء او تواصل سريع لحل اي لخبطه طارئه وده وارد بيحصل كتير لازم تواصل في وقتها هو مش توصيل وخلاص..
It would be great if more restaurants were added
"Uber eats is the best food delivery app by far, mainly for their customer service. They are super efficient, fair and helpful and honestly I stopped using any other delivery services because none of them compare to Uber eats (and Uber in general actually, I've only ever had good relations with their customer service teams)"
It works well.
Its switches off during orders and it keeps saying verify payment and blocks the order
Super easy to use!!
Good
Good service
"Uber Eats has by far the best restaurant selection to choose from, but the fees are outrageous compared to the other apps. There are multiple fees."
They deceive people in name of discount offers
It's not started in our area in vapi it's disappointing
Easy and fast to order. My order was even brought 20 minutes before the expected time!
Terrible app. Still waiting for a refund from last weekend. Sent me the wrong food and kept my money.
"My delivery time went from 35-45 minutes to 1 hour, to 1 hour and 30 minutes."
Good :)
You took my money and didn't deliver
Greeat
"Only Uber can make something that cost $1, cost $5"
Obviously it's a good app I just really hate when they make mistakes frequently
If there is no option to register then how could i supposed to put password to open one the worst app
"All this app ever tells me is, ""We're not quite where you are yet."" I find this to be annoying as I've been in 5 different locations. And all those times I could not be helped because I keep getting told the same thing. 😑"
Good
Delivering wrong food and impossible to get in touch with support..... so basically charging you for their mistakes
ممتاز
Excellent
"I ordered 6 meals 5 for kids and 1 for myself, food came to the house on a bike and food was really cold and hard kids couldn't even eat it, I called uber support and all they said Is to write a complaint on the app but yet they done nothing about it,spent £27 food went in the bin no refunds or replacement has to spend more money and go out to get food myself."
"It's ridiculous that you are charged for a mistake and the only way to fix the mistake is to call them and waste time talking to a representative that sounds like a porn star. Obviously if I order from different locations, that means I use the app frequently. I am never EVER using this app again!"
Wow really fast and you see where your driver is amazing
This last update broke the app
I'm not satisfied with you are connected the app with zomato
Excellent
Muy buena.
Nice
"Five star because I love the app. I did have a girl forget my drink one time, but other than that love how easy it is to use!"
Improve uber app and make colour full
"Its good, very"
"1st time order, food missing food received some was cold. No contact had to leave message and reply was we will get back to you soon.Kids missed out on half their dinner"
It was good. Only problem is selecting stores for pick up. It's only specified when u try to check out
Everything is great but way too expensive. Meal prices are inflated over competitor apps. No option for membership for a one off monthly delivery payment for power users. The only benefit to uber eats is speed of delivery which I use it for.
I have been ordering through uber eats. But on the 6th of feb I had the worst experience with a delivery. I had an issue with my delivery address and the delivery guy refused to deliver the food. Now I can't book a cab or order food through uber as it shows me that I have to pay Rs.500 and when I contacted the customer service they say this is their procedure and offered no solution. Really dissapointed this just another money eating app.
"When u insert ur card details, it says ur card does doesn't exist even though u are using the app"
Ive been waiting nearly 2 hours for my food because theres no one to deliver my food but i cant cancel my order without being charged another $13ish (my food was $17ish) because i didnt somehow magically know there wasnt any drivers out tonight
Good
Good
Good delivery drivers. Food doesn't always arrive hot.
Needs a cash option
I need to delete card details as a payment option but it's not allowing me to cause it says that's the only payment option I have but i prefer cash payments. Please help Update. Concerning your response I've tried that method but it doesnt allow me to. I would like to remove my details please I would like to cancel my membership
no way to contact support or driver once they marked the order as delivered. my order never arrived
My friends have recommended this app to me a million times and it won't even download it says it needs trouble shooted
Horrible experience
"Too bad late night 11pm and on, it becomes very limited on seletions, proximity issues, not enough drivers, the list could go on....I live right in Denver so I know of TONS of 24hr places that aren""t avaliable. Doens't make sense...or i woul've rated it 4-5 stars."
"Delivery was terrible in Dhaka. Firstly, the location map can't pinpoint you always. Then the delivery man does not come to the doorstep. And this happened twice."
Irritating and a waste of time. I placed two orders and waited hours. Both said on the order status page that the driver was picking them up. Me and my family where starving but waited patiently as we could only to have them cancelled. No reason why. Just cancelled after the second time I just went to the restaurant myself. Total waste of time and very frustrating I wont be using them again.
Good
Perfect
Good app
Good
Good to order
Good
Full of fraud drivers.paid them cash then they reported that I didn't pay and uber eats it's not doing anything about it am supposed to pay again whilist I paid.which means I gave your driver my money for free.
When i was opening uber eats its says order from ZAMATO gets exited offers from your favorite restaurant why is like that
"After finding out how they rort the businesses that are signed up to their app, I don't want to support it anymore. Disgraceful. They charge the venue a large % of the bill on top of the delivery fee they charge to customers. Heartless company."
👍
Great App. Recommend. The developers also help if you have any concerns. Excellent!
The wait times to get orders often gets to be ridiculous amounts of time. Wish there was a more reliable service
I keep trying to find a way to contact uber eats to let them know I have an error on my app it keeps saying location to far or order can't be made several times no true customer support I'm dissatisfied
Fraud
"The app has been working great, it would just be nice if you guys could stipulate on the app which are the Halaal restaurants like how MR Delivery has...which shows the halaal restaurants to eat at."
Waiting over a hour for white Castle
Takes too long. Wrong estimation time.
Miss you uber eats india ☹️
Before McDonald's had delivery i was upset every time i was high... Not every time butamy times. Other good food that os better
Great
This app is very bad
Extremely subpar Trying to get someone to help you with why an order can't be or won't be delivered is asking for a miracle. Now they have posted an automated response that says let us help however if you go to said link you can't get in touch with an actual person. Extreme waste of time deleting the app. If I could edit this to 0 stars I would.
Good
👍👍👍
On time thank you so much Michael
Good and helpfully
When i try to put an oder it says sever error. When i re open some random oder has been placed in my account. This happened to me twice now.
Login problem all the time in Bangladesh
Never got my food just took my money Very disappointed
"When it works well it is great. But when things go wrong the lack of communication is appalling. Today our order was cancelled >1.5 hours after ordering with no explanation and us getting very hungry. We got a refund but this is not good enough for wasting our time like this. How come neither the restaurant nor delivery rider were able to communicate the problem??? Edit: you send me to a help page that I already filled in, and responded by noting that I had been refunded. This is no help!"
"Exceptional(ly) taste(less). Three times, delivery was 'available'. I ordered. Three times, after the order was accepted (immediately = no refund, of course), I watch the app estimate farther and farther... away. Then it was no longer available. 1. Find zero relevant (textually) help articles. 2. Call local shop *to explain to THEM *twice* UBER isn't delivering; to which they respond, ""We have no idea why."" 3. a: drive there myself. b: lose the other two and my $ to these ___ . UEats, get real"
Plz confirm it over phone before order confiremed
Effective and Efficient
Absolutely terrible! So by the time my food arrived it's cold and half of my order is missing. I understand that's not uber's fault. My problem came from trying to get a phone number to discuss my order. It was basically impossible. So I go to the online help center and they CHARGED ME FOR IT. On my 24 dollar order I was only refunded 9 dollars but charged 6 for reaching out to someone. Uninstalled and will never use again.
Do not download this app or have anything to do with them. They illegally got hold of my bank details and attempted to take money. I've never used them or given them my details. They are now being investigated for fraud
"I placed an order AFTER MAKING SURE MY ADDRESS WAS RIGHT and when the driver called me, he was at the last place I had ordered from (office) instead of where I had set the location to. I called customer service and explained the glitch but they still took my money and I didn't get what I had ordered. That's just theft with extra steps. Update (Reply Again) : They're liars and thieves. No progress on this whatsoever for weeks. No concern for customers and no qualms about stealing from them."
They contacted me and explained the charges
"Suddenly after getting refunded for an order that was incorrect I am unable to make any orders, this has been for 2 weeks now"
👍 great
I order and it wasn't even a minute I canceled and I still got charged.
I'm happy with the service so far so nothing negative to say but good job keep it up!
No contact button other than help with issues but when you have an issue with the app there is no actual contact link or help with that issue. Your agents are very ubprofessional and rude.
Awesome for a new mum who can't leave the house.
well we only got half our order
"Was double charged a tip bc of an app glitch and after several days of being completely ignored by support, I finally called and was still passed along back to support, that kept asking me the same question over and over or answering things that did not pertain to me. The app doesn't work well and support is truly terrible. Be careful with this one - needs work. Edit: still nothing. Got the same useless repeat support responses that completely ignored the situation. This app steals money."
"Edit: as expected, ubereats commented here as if they'd help but I got the same laughable responses from support asking for screenshots that I had already provided multiple times, and then they disregarded the proof in the screenshots entirely, offered no proof of their own, and closed the query. At some point this app WILL steal your money. It's just a matter of when."
My first order is not received because the deliver guy's phone battery died. And there is no way me to cancel and order again. Luckily selected the cash option🤷 please improve the app.
Not too bad of an app. Good you can pay cash. Or add money.
My driver wasn't answering my food was cold
"Exceptional service , everytime!"
"Install Glovo instead. Uber eats has terrible service, very dishonest. The app works terribly bad giving out wrong geolocational information. Their delivery people are liars and this company supports lies before siding with the customer when orders aren't delivered."
Nic
Awesome experience
Does not work. Can't even enter an address to search
"This app is trash. The deliveries are even more so with incompetent drivers that can't be bothered to do a pretty simple job to its fullest extent. Messing up orders, forgetting drinks/food, not paying actual attention to whatever an order has requested, and delivering a mess of what should have been food and/or drinks. Cancelling  because looking for the correct address is too problematic, not having the initiative to make a call to the customer. Is this not a ""job"" to take seriously? GD waste."
Tasty
Amazing
There literally getting paid more then the people delivering and some restaurant mark up prices
Won't let me use my card all of a sudden app is now unusable
Awesome
I put the correct address of mine in the app but it always show the wrong address when the delivery is coming.
"They add a surcharge on top of the delivery fee for the food. So expensive to do it this way, I'd rather starve thanks."
We're not feeling all those fees and service cost that Uber slaps on the bill. Used to be much better before.
None of my promotions added on. Thanks
Easy to use fast and great costumer service
Adrienne in ATL did a fantastic job I will order again based of my experience.
"Yooo!!! these taxes from yours are to damn HIGH i just tried because i uninstall month ago and re install now to just see this madness tell me how you people can argue i put a burguer king so close to my house the delivery fee was $1.90 and just put a Whopper $5.25 and nothing more just a Whopper how the.... ended $10.89 for just a single Solo plain whopper where the hell all thoose ""Taxes"" came from???"
"App always works well. Unfortunately, absolutely terrible customer service. Driver picked up the wrong order from the resturaunt (accident). The driver was apologetic and polite. I spoke to Uber Eats customer support, they refused to call the resturaunt and rectify the issue. Instead, they cancelled my order and said it would take 5 - 10 business days for the money to return to my account. I was told ''there's nothing I can do' , then got hung up on. Took my money, and cancelled my food."
Love my delivery driver. Great 1st time experience!
Delivery was late food was cold.food was gross couldn't even eat it I had to throw out..Waste of $$$
Didn't deliver and didn't refund. Claimed that this was my fault even though I have a porch to place food on...
Well written app.
Total garbage I would write 0 if I could never any drivers and when there are drivers it takes forever and it's not their fault nor the restaurant it's the app I've spent numerous hours on the phone calling Uber because of my orders being messed up I am uninstalling this app I'm never using Uber Eats again if you want food from anywhere doordash their customer service is so easy ubereats you have to search day and night to find a phone number if you need a phone number comment under here
Really convienient.
Good app
I dont get promotions eventhough i shared the promotion link.plz fix this issue
"Usually good, but when the meals are.delayed, there is no way to give immediate feedback to Uber."
"Keeps crashing, awful app"
The numerous charges are ridiculous. I shouldn't be charged for having a small order or 5 dollars for delivery. I would love to use this app but it's too expensive. I'll have an order of 10 dollars but with all the extra added on fees it's like 15 dollars more. A 10 dollar order turns into a 25 dollar order🙄
"Absolute trash. Nothing works. Coupons? Ran out of time even though it's not expired. Card info is wrong for every single card put in. Not declined, just said wrong information? Half the restaurants don't have their full menu so if you have a kid chances are they won't have the kids meals as an option. Every single email said it already had an account and this was my first time trying to use this app. If I could I would give negative stars. It double charged me after I couldn't get my food."
Amazing 😂
My experience with Uber Eats was terrible their response team was not helpful at all and the restaurants are always getting my orders wrong with no refunds it was great at first but just got worse over time plus this new Rewards program stinks I spent up to Gold status all's I got for it was $5 Uber cash that's an insult just another example of corporate greed I closed my account
You give me food. 5/5
"Its an pretty great app, the restaurants could edit their option choice buttons better. Some on them say theres a choice for this or that then when you click on it it doesnt allow you to choose this or that and you get nothing. Also theres a service fee on top of deliver fee and tip usually makes my order 10-20$ more then it should be. Convience is a wicked thing to pay for. 10-20$ is a bit much though."
Easy to use 👍
Food yum-yum
Nice app
Always left me satisfied and smiling
"I enjoy using this app as it is convenient for when I'm unable to leave or simply dont want to drive to get food. The main issue I have is the inconsistency of restaurant availability. If they're all closed the app wont say that, it will just say uber eats is not in your area. And some time within the last few weeks suddenly all my favorite restaurants are now too far away and there are only like 5-6 available to me now."
I literally received half of my order this past time. I do not consider this a fault on Uber eats but the restaurant I ordered from.
Offered 50% off order good for 24 hours. Sent to me at 8pm and expires 230pm tomorrow. How is that 24 hours? Giving up on uber all around. Turning into a joke
"Plus d'une heure d'attente pour une annulation .. le livreur ne donne aucune explication, d'abord il dit (au bout de plus d'une heure qu'il est crevé, puis qu'il a endommagé la commande et enfin il annule) plus de 30 min entre la récupération de commande et l'annulation alors que nous sommes à 800m maximum....."
"I had to change my 5 star. My orders are always late and the food cold sometimes. I love Uber eats, but the late arrivals are frustrating."
Easy to use and can send food to other people too!
great customer service.
Easy to use
"Very helpful app, Very neat design, however, keeps crashing and throwing server errors more often than expected!"
"No básico é igual a todo resto, só marquei pior porque a opção de cancelar o pedido é EXTREMAMENTE ESCONDIDA."
They never can find my address
They suck! And there customer service sucks more! They rip you off.
Incredibly convenient by top notch drivers!
My payment method is declining its saying your payment method is invalid. I contacted with my bank but it also didn't work. I also added another card but it is also declined.
Easy and convenient.
"the worst out if all delivery options.. food is always cold or order wrong. worst is when they say they delivered food and never did, and you cant reach a live person to know wth is going on! will never use them again and blocking any charge to my bank... criminals"
Unprofessional drivers. Too many fees.
Terrible
first and second order was very fast .... but my third order they cancel my order without a notice or refund !! i cant log in also ... they just stole my money i was a fool to trust them
Makes you wait 2 hours then cancels your order
Great
Sat waiting for over an hour and a half so far for food. Still waiting currently. Theres no way to cancel my order or request a refund. Just sat here at 12:20am £12 down and still nothing. Havent even gotten a driver yet. Very angry.
First order took 2 and 1/2 hrs. Then canceled
Better than grubhun
"This is good for an emergency night for my family when I don't get the chance to cook. But on a $40 meal end up having to pay taxes plus roughly another $15 and delivery fees and service fees. I find that kind of pricey, I wish that the restaurants I usually like ordering from would do delivery themselves, this company is making a killing! Aside from all that, the app is pretty easy to use and there can be a good variety depending on where you live and what's available around your area."
"When all else fails, Uber eats is the way to go!"
Thumb up!!
Been waiting 3 day for app to download a have a new phone
"The app is great overall, easy to use. My only complaint is that; I wish there was a way for the restaurant to not make the order until there is a driver available. Because of this the order is often cold and later than expected. I always assume it will take the longest time +10mins. What can you do? 🤷‍♀️"
"Turns my account into a company linked account, and won't let me get out of it, then sends me vouchers and coupons I can't use - all the time - because I have a company linked account which won't let you use vouchers!!! Useless App, bye I'm going to Deliveroo 👋👋"
Uber eats is stupid they don't provide any help when you have problems with your orders. I got a unsatisfying order and uber eats did not provide me with a refund or new order don't use this garbage ass app or you will be scammed too eventually they don't provide refunds
Had a discount coupon of $15. My order total was $13 but the receipt showed that I had to pay $0 and yet they charged me $15. Fraudsters!
Great
"Everytime i try to check out it says verify payment but all my cards info and stuff is accurate i tried deleting and reinstalling app, signing in and out, etc. Now I can't even log in anymore takes me to a delivery detail page which is already set up but it wont even load full screen after"
So far so good
"Too difficult to figure out how to use a promo, ended up accidentally ordering before applying promo. No recourse. Help options terrible. I'll change my rating if im refunded the amount i would have saved with the promo."
No option to disable notifications for promos
Great app. Would recommend to others.
"Never , ever using this app, or site again , I never got my delivery. I COULDN'T EVEN GET THROUGH TO CUSTOMER SERVICE"
I've never used a food delivery service before like this and I like it I will definitely use it again...
Perfeito
Every single time i order anything the driver goes to some other place as soon as they pick up the order the address changes i have to call the driver and tell them some times they dont pick up they say the address is the same but the gps makes them go somewhere else
"Des vrais crosseurs, service à la clientèle vaut pas d'la marde, pu jamais"
"Great food and fast service. Uber is a great service. Thank you,"
Excellent
Really awful customer service. Had a complaint about an awful delivery. they just kept asking me the same questions - I kept answering and they kept repeating them. Think they just want you to go away - there's no option to phone anyone or anything. Go use Just Eat - much better
Your drivers are never on time
Convenience and wide variety of cuisine selections at various price points makes this an essential app.
Great app :D
The app is fast and easy. Love it!!! Service is great!
"Terrible, food is always late , estimated time is never accurate"
Great
Perfect ❤
How can you use this app if you can't even sign in. It makes you register it doesn't allow you to sign in when you already have an account. Terrible app.
Uber Eats?! Uber Outs! Never using again. Terrible customer service. Charged twice and refusing to refund. Impossible to speak to an actual human to resolve. Terrible company.
1. Install app 2. Open app Expected: able to see the list of restaurants Result: sign-in screen with zero nacigation option Why would I want to sign in if there are no restaurants options near me? I cannot not know that through this app in the beginning.
I loved this app for a while but i had to request a quite few of refunds cause my order was incorrect now most of the areas get my order wrong and if i get correct items i dont ask for them to be refunded only the messed up stuff i throw away cause i have dietary restrictions. So cause of that when someone gave me no meal i had to politely ask them to not charge me even got hung up on 2 times(i had security footage proof) the only person who helped was a lovely lady who listened.
Lots of choices and fast arrival
"I literally just gave as $200.00 away because apparently the guy came but it's not true I wanna sue so bad, if there's an alternative where you live choose that one"
"Sometimes I could get lazy, Creat app"
It won't let me sign up
"Worst application to order food ever. It will not allow me make mobile phone modifications to place an order and there is no, and I mean absolutely no, customer service availability!!!!"
Excellent. I'm glad that the promotions are ALREADY there to apply now. Instead of customers adding it themselves after receiving a email promotion.
Fast and reliable app!!
"After too many orders either not delivered at all, or incorrect items received, I'm just done. I might not have been but today's episode ended with being told they can do precisely nothing fix it - no refund or resending my correct food."
They have the worst customer service. They failed to deliver my full order and would not refund me the rest of my money or at least send me what was missing from this order. I do not recommend using Uber eats app
"Fix your program, so that the latest arrival time is higher than estimated time. My estimate is keep going up and going over one hour. Just add 2 hours to the order time."
"The moment I downloaded it & put my 4-digit password that I was sent, it said ""something went wrong, try again later"". I kept trying and finally uninstalled the app."
"You guys are fast even in rainy conditions, you deserve a thumbs up 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️"
"Definitely as of late, having food carriers that are walking when their vehicle method says car or bike is getting too out of hand. Will definitely be sticking to other apps that actually only use cars, because getting food in Canadian winters delivered by a person walking to and from the restaurant while paying full price is absolutely absurd."
Super fácil
I have used uber eats quite abit. I'm done. Over 50% of all my orders have been messed up. Not sure who to blame here except the people I payed..
My order got cancelled after waiting for over an hour
Excellent service
"March 2, 2020 This app doesn't accept my current card, and it suck because it is the only way to get a quick meal without cooking."
Limited selection of food non existent customer service and 0 accountability I understand that this uses 3rd party drivers and restaurants but the fact that there is no one to help me with any of my delivery issues considering how many mistakes are made is unacceptable
"Entregador sumiu com o pedido, uber eats apenas estornou. Resumindo, estou com dor de cabeça de fome, fiquei meia hora sem trabalhar aguardando o entregador e recebo apenas o estorno para ter que fazer outro pedido em outro App. Absurdo"
The driver was very professional
Lite!
I love this app i used it when i am hungry
Not open hotels only app address save many time ask adress not a good food delivery emergency time dghhgderdddddfgghhhgggghhhghggggdw33tyyuiijjjjjeethhhhhhjjhhhhhhhhbbbhhhhhcfgggggggyyyhgghhhhh Hhbbvvvbgg
Love this app. I'm a truck driver so can't always drive to get food
"Fast service, great food"
Robbed me of $30 today when I guess the driver couldn't find me so he just cancelled my order without refund 🤬🤬🤬
Good
Worst
I make an order and i fell asleep. I paid $53 and i didnt hear the call. I loost the order and the money.
Says a certain amount for the delivery fee when picking out foods then changes when in checkout. Aggravating to say the least.
"App doesn't work, can't log in. Rubbish"
Nevigation was wrong
"Disgusting service service. Food spilt, packet torn, food all over the place. Unacceptable. Shocking service."
Fantastic App. Delivery and Customer Service is on point
Very good
Cant change address before delivery starts. Seriously!?
Worst experience whenever trying to login it's not happening
Good app
15% service charge
Brilliant service
Very poor struggling to order
Disgusting app
Good app
I love it
"Worst experience ever, I've been locked out of my account. I sent an email and you guys replied and said you've fixed it but I still can't order!!!!"
Great
Excellent
Very poor service and customer care not responding
"I used it last night for the first time, it was fine. Today it doesn't even recognize my phone number to log in. And on my son's phone it already had his email account on file but he has never had a uber eats account. I'll go back to GrubHub. Thanks."
Good
Sick!! ♡♡♡♡♡
I love it
Good
Worst app ever seen Not being able to oder anything Waste of time using this app
Great and easy to use.
Every order so far has been wrong
"Issues with payment, kept saying phone number needs to be verified but in my account my phone numbers been verified. Very annoying, cancelled my account."
"Swapped phones and now I cant sign in, literally have to create a new account"
Brilliant and easy interface
I dunno why I just cant get to the app or order anything even after registering! It's annoying. It just keeps askin for my mobile number and registered email and says your email is already registered! I know that and want to order! But how??
Awesome 😊😊😊😍😍😍
Fastes food delivery but food quatity low what they included in there menu .
Thums up
"It's a pretty good app, hasn't failed me yet"
"The worse all for order food, no customer service, uber is 0"
"Really, my full order was not received"
"Unfortunately Uber Eats isn't what it was when it started to operate. Nowadays I have issues with almost every single order and quite honestly, I believe it is due to the lack of professionalism from certain operators (mostly drivers/delivery people). I've now uninstalled Uber Eats since there are other better alternatives (where I have much less issues)."
"Download the app, new customer and it keeps asking for a password I've never set up. And for an email address. I'AM A NEW CUSTOMER!! Guess what, phone numbers change and I am unable to set up new account because of the person that previously had my number. That sucks.. GrubHub it is 🤷‍♀️"
"Today I am going to use this app first time , i dont know what will be my experience. But I am i will 100% share my experience here.. rating is just my perception. I will change it after using this app.. Now friends after installing. Please don't use. Because it have been owned by Zomato and. One of worst food delivery app in india is Zomato. It eat your money nothing to give u eat. So stay away. Thnks. Uniinstall"
"Was delivered an incomplete order missing 13$ of food, only received 5$ credit when I asked for a refund of all the missing food and haven't heard from Uber eats since! Horrible customer service! It's like they don't care about the customers satisfaction. UPDATE: They still haven't helped me since their reply to my review. I've reached out to their Twitter and their support email multiple times and no action has been taken! I am ready to file a chargeback with my bank."
"Why would it let me order to an address 3 hours away with no warning? It did this twice and both times I had to argue with support to not get charged. The warnings you're supposed to get doesn't always come up, it's a bug in the application. This combined with the constantly increasing service fees and delivery fees make this service not worth using."
It's keep on showing me update your billing settings I don't understand please help me
Seriously ❤️ best app for foodies 🙏🥰 Luv the experience with Uber eats 🤝
Great delivery service and friendly
Quick deliveries
Poor service 😥Sad to say but I must
"Worst customer service in the world. Answering our queries with the same context copy paste and not interacting with us like a normal customer service. Unprofessional and unable to fix my issue. Update: Uber eats is not working keeps telling me to verify payment even when i chose cash option did everything from Uninstall to re install, added credit card and it simply doesn't work Not useful, how can i use uber chat?"
"pls do come back uber,no one can provide a service like u,hoping u will come back"
Very bad
I like this app very much but now This app is not working.. It directs me toward zomato! Only zomato going to work or how's it?? Let me know
Regardless you need a cur off percentage on what u charge if the order is over 40 bucks your fees become ridiculous
Will not be using this again.
Good promotions
Just Splendid
This is incredibly difficult for support! If you have an issue you may aswell uninstall this app because the support is a nightmare!
"La aplicación cometió un error con mi orden porque no se aplicó una promoción que tenía. Envié los pantallazos con la evidencia de que sí había agregado la promoción y del precio que me aparecía de la orden, pero solo me envían respuestas automáticas y tengo una deuda en la aplicación. Terrible servicio al cliente cuando cometen un error."
😘😘😘
"I had booked a delivery for 17.45pm @ 11.30am and while inputing my payment details, the delivery time changed to ASAP and I was not available to collect my delivery downstairs and I had to give the food away since I was coming back at 17.30pm. I lost money and food. I spoke to a consultant and they couldn't redirect the delivery man to deliver it at the requested time. I'm not impressed whatsoever and I WAS CHARGED on top of that."
Great app
I like uber eats
Great
"Not happy with this delivery service, placed an order with a restaurant and the driver was late to pick up order which added 20 mins more for delivery which made the order run over 1hr 20 mins. When drive received order and food was 8 mins away from me, everything was canceled at last minute and I was stuck almost 2 hrs later with no food to take with medication. This was a very bad experience, would have gave them no stars for no food. Worst off there isn't anyone you can call. Very unhappy."
If there is an option for giving negative marks i wish to have it. Such a rubbish service from Uber my husband called the driver and explained him for 20 mins and he was at the right location. He started swearing on my husband and saying i am not your servant you have to give accurate location. The location which we have shared with him was dropped pin that is 100%correct. Where is the service is this what Uber calls a service to threat the person??? Such case must be reported to local police
حلو جدا ❤️❤️
Lackluster
Can't enter payment info
Excellent
The delivery service is excellent and my food came really fast. It's a simple easy app to use at any time of day
Excelente
Good honestly but link your card at your own risk.
"Works well , good deals , quick delivery times."
Been waiting for my food for more than an hour
"The app has always been hard to use, but now errors on the enter my location page make it impossible to enter and find my location and then the app just closes."
The application is not friendly use at all It's complicated and all menu in English there's no Arabic menus.
great food delivery app
"Picture this, It's late friday night.. You land home, wifes out.. Lets order maccies! My child did not receive her food at all! Rude driver on arrival but he works for idiots so I'm not surprised.. Uber eats respond to this inconvenience by saying "" We are sorry, we cannot guarantee the restaurant will deliver everything on the order"" WHAT?! I have in black and white you guys admitting you cannot carry out the task your organisation has set up for? Deleted, never again, go scam someone else!"
Every single time I have ordered my food has been dropped and spilled. Very unhappy with uber Eats.
Ubereats is one of the best food delivering apps which I had used in India But unfortunately it is not there now So i request you to get back this app as soon as possible I want Ubereats in India
I didn't Received My Ubereats Credits Not In Uber Ride App nor in Zomato Account. And also On Complaint No Reply I Received
Call centre agent is so rude and unwilling to help.
أول ما أشتركت معهم كانت الخدمة ممتازة. لكن بالفترة الاخيرة صاروا يعطونوا طلبات خطأ ومرات تكون ناقصة. وخدمة العملاء ما يردون علي بس يقولولي أنه راح نتواصل معك لكن نصابين يسحبون علي وآخر مرة اتهموني بأني كذاب. لكن إن شاء الله لن يتم التعامل معهم مرة آخرى. وهذي كانت تجربتي معهم . أتمنى ما تصير مع أحد غيري
Apauling
Excellent thank Mr Temptation
"Metem nojo no apoio e na fraco suporte ao cliente. São inúmeros os casos de engano por parte dos restaurantes e que a uber se desresponsabiliza do sucedido, se há enganos então os custos que sejam creditados a quem se engana, não o consumidor final. Fiz uma encomenda de um jantar para dois, o restaurante assumiu o erro, foi dito para cancelar a reserva que o restaurante iria cobrir a mesma. O que é que a uber faz? Cobra parcialmente, mantém a taxa de entrega e o cliente final sem nada."
It doesn't download or give me the option to put in a password
Helps me appreciative good food
stop taking maccies offline when I want a munch g
I was contacted by an ubereats employee and was told that there was no drivers near my area to get my food at the moment and that I should cancel my order. So I did and I tried to contact customer support to get a refund back and was told they can't help me get my money back so people be careful because they won't help you.
Trash. Waiting hours for food and having sketchy delivery people is not cool.
"Payment Method - Once you register your's credit card, you can't delete it. I know Uber wants to reduce the use of cash, but I still hate it if we can't delete our registered credit card."
"Exceptional, Quick and Efficient, love love love Uber Eats... ❤️"
Very good app
"The app is good, and I prefer to add the distance between me and the restaurants."
Easy to use and quick very pleased.thankyou
Easy to use and helpful on days I don't want to cook. Can't fault this app
It was easy to use nd its a nice app Bt had a prblm tht i could'nt cancel one meal at McD
Never recieve my order
Worst service by this Uber Team my order did not picked by rider for 1 hour and no reply and no contact number or no helpline or they did not reply over call the worst experience and also they charged me 2 times on 2 different order which was not delivered and still they are not refunding
"My Uber account is hacked, no safety in save my privacy, Uber applications is not safe, I hacked easily more than one time, and I asked for a solution but it still hacked. I will remove it"
Osthir
Excellent
"Very good, helps me get fed"
"I am in KSA, it's not showing any AlBaik restaurants even though I am searching I could not found"
Actually the thing is neither m able to sign in nor register myself to uber nor there is ny other option even . I use apps by my samsung galaxy tab a7
They need to add more restaurants
Worst app ever
Awesome experience
Ok
Not letting me pay with cash and no help or support on app regarding this (edit for developer) still doesn't give me an option to send you a message just help tips regarding uber cash but I'm afraid my sterling pound is not uber cash!!!! App deleted will stick with JUST EAT thanks!
Customar suport bad
Good
Good app
Ggg
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best service and quick
"""Order location too far from store"" then why show me them in the first place, I feel like 80% or more of my orders never get completed, guess they don't want my money."
Best app to order
Fast and friendly service
I have a 400.promotion so does that mean I can get food worth 400 for free ?(
If Uber cash would work for rides and Uber eats on the first try Everytime I would give this set of apps a 5+* rating but for whatever reason no matter how much Uber cash I have it will never ever work smoothly without severe hassle and several messages to the help department
"Great app at the start, but now for some reason everytime i add a tip i have two payments go out my account one complete payment and one broken down order and tip separate. Apart for that its great."
தேவுடியா பசங்க
So far good
If uber is taken over by zomato then delet the app why are you westing data boss.. Don't you have intellect dont you bother to do it so... Worse people No value of customer
Hours with no install
i love this app
Need more restaurants around the area
I use this app regularly. I love the convenience it brings. It's just fantastic!! Would recommend it to everyone 😋
"""SERVER ERROR"""
feeling ripped off yes I got a refund but that's not the point don't sign up 2 a delivery job if ur not actually going to deliver very dissapointed an hungry
It's a decent app but my orders are almost never on time and there have been missing items too.
I love Ubering great job I love it..
Perfect
Lit
Good
"In reference to my previous comment, I am happy to indicate that my order complications were attended to expeditiously. Great stuff!! :)"
Fees have gone up. People have delivered my food with animals in car. Person has not match driver. I try not to use this service as much anymore. Note: I was asked what I thought so I was not interested in a response to my review. IT STILL STANDS. Thank you!
"This app is not working at all. Start app, tells me to enter new address, input address, ""could not find location"" it says or something like that."
Pretty good!
"I like how Uber eats can wait over 30 min only to cancel your order. No explanation, no compensation for a waste of my time."
Its mint
"Why are there Uber walkers, the service is so slow and my food gets cold by the time it gets to my place. At least have a bike or something. Also, food orders get mixed up all the time. Couriers should check the items before they just walk out. And customer service is non existent because the company knows how much costs would be incurred if they had real people as customer service rather than just a list of steps that we are already capable of doing. Trash"
"The app works beautifully, but I have had two bad experiences with Uber drivers stating that I did not pay them when I paid in cash and tipped well on both occasions. I never received contact after reporting my issues and I will sadly not be using them again. I actually deserve an apology for receiving such shoddy service after being a good customer for a very long time. Disappointing."
👍👍👍
Good delivery but unfortunately not too much to choose of. The good restaurants close down before 5 then you can't order anymore.
i love this app no more waiting in a line
Nice app
Great food thank you x
"The worst customer service ever! I placed an order and tracked delivery driver right up to the order being picked up only to find it was canceled. Called the restaurant and they said they've handed the order over to the driver. There's no customer service ph number on the app so I found the driver customer service and spoke with ""Paul"" who dumped me through to ""Kim"" which by the way these names are all made up and said they can't tell me why my order was cancelled!! Hopeless customer service!!"
Waited 35 minutes for food.. which was canceled randomly... no notice because pop eyes was out of chicken. No credits given for issue. Waited 10 minutes for that notice. I recommend any other good deliver service or just make food. Uber eats is trash
"At the beginning I was Like a good fish biting those discount promos, it was good, few months later all of the sudden: ""promos expiring at 7pm on the exp day"", ""small order fee $2 extra""...Rather go fetch the food myself! PS I'm smart enough to know if the promo applies to my specific city and country and know how to read and interpret terms before applying them...I was waiting for the typical condescending discrediting reply."
More of a comment on the service. Need to work on delivery time but cant be mad at individual drivers with lives. Pay them a better sustainable wage rather than treating them like waiters with a car.
"Authentication problem, Try again toast"
I love the app since my wife don't cook me 🥺🥺🤣
Love the service!
Its overly priced instead of having higher delivery fees they put an additional fee on everything. Not to mention a lot of places will just cancel a order :( Also drivers steal food and ubereats will not give compensation for the inconvenience. This is a true shame. I expected more for your long time customers...
Dante. Great app
Good customer service agents
Great fresh hot and fast
I really appreciated the fact that Rick waited for my order to be completed.
Great app and service. Love using it.
Little expensive fees
Solid
"I've tried on multiple occasions to use this app and it always gives me an error on""unable to fetch location"""
What is the point of special instructions if your not going to follow them.
Great
"I moved so i didn't know what my address was. They supposedly have a function for it, but it put it in the completely wrong place. So, I described very specifically where I was, driver couldnt find me, order was cancelled and they kept my money with some bull apology. I will NEVER use uber eats again, I will never recommend it again, I'm about to give door dash a 5 star again and I'm only ever using lyft. Oh btw their support email isn't monitored so I cant contact them because they have no #."
Good job. Thank you
Everything is always unavailable
Good
"Order canceled right at the exact time it was estimated to be delivered with no explanation or way to contact anybody. No one came to my door, I've been waiting in the livingroom. This is unacceptable. I could've gone out and got food already in the time I've waited for this ridiculous order!!!"
I would just like to be notified if my driver is picking up / dropping off another order on the way.
Service prices delivery price ..those charges alone bring $10 meal to $19 smh
Hard to find
"Since some update or other, whenever I leave the app it deletes my cart. Very frustrating. I'll switch between this and other food delivery apps trying to find something appealing and just when I've decided to go with Uber I discover my carefully planned meal has been deleted and I have to re-enter it all over again. I understand people could potentially mistakenly order something left from days before but at least put a time on it. Almost immediately my cart is deleted."
Very convenient and easy to use
No se hacen responsables por el reembolso cuando cancelas un pedido
I've been sick so i uber eats and this is the second time over driver came with a dog chilling by my food bags I don't have nothing against dogs but I cannot eat any food have dog hairs all over the bag. Its gross. Why do you guys allow drivers to have dogs while picking up food.
They keep your money and dont put it back on your card
TOP SHELF
Great pp
Can't edit an order before checking out.
Order comes quickly 😁
Ehh it was ok. Just hate to receive cold food...
It great. Delivery times are statifactory. A bit pricey but still reasonable.
My food was ice cold
Porque si
Love it
I am hungry. Waiting for my free food. Excellent app.
Doesn't work. Keeps telling me to put an address but then nothing happens. Galaxy S8+
This app takes so long to deliver your food
Awesome
"Terrible. I have all the food delivery apps and UberEats is absolutely the worst. Charged $30 dollars for an accidental cancel. Food was cold. Order wrong. And UberEats hasn't even RESPONDED to any of my complaints and still has not reversed the INSANE $30 dollar fee. Go with: Seamless, GrubHub, PostMates, DoorDash or litterally ANY other service. Had solid results with the others. UberEats is getting un-installed."
It seid it had kfc but it dont
I give the app 5 stars but not the service. The service isnt always great
App works nice. Only problem is some business's that are registered as halal aren't actually halal. CALL AND DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF THE RESTAURANT IS ACTUALLY HALAL!
Worked great until recently. Now I have to go on the computer as the app just asks for a new delivery address and will not even search. Cannot get past that screen. Even uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck
Gold Standard Food Delivery
This would not let me place an order all it did was keep showing errors abd saying go to some help screen you cant find
"My app has been very buggy lately. I recently tried to order pizza but the order would not process, so eventually gave up and used my friend's phone to order. Ended up with 3 lots of pizza (most of it unwanted) all of which we paid for - have tried to find a way to report this and to request a refund, but it's incredibly difficult to find any contact info. Now, my app isn't working at all, and gets stuck on the 'add your delivery address' page. Very disappointed."
Top App!!
No way to contact drivers that just never moves. Uber doesn't give a rats behind if your food never arrives.
"It's not as good as Doordash! 1)There's no bottom to refund a customer right away without calls and wait time.2) they give time, when they don't know how long it'll take to make it. A large pizza in 9 min. No way!!!!! It's 20 min. And many times there's no choice to adjust the time. Neither a bottom to cancel an order for a restaurant. App developers could do better I believe!!!"
Amazing
Lousy!!! Waiting for delivery and WAS CANCELED because driver couldn't fimd address. I gave phone # for driver to call...but never called. Also gave delivery instructions and maybe didn't Read them! SAD!
"I am so tired of missing food. Just not worth it. Doesn't matter what restaurant we have ordered from. We never ever get everything we ordered, or the correct food. Yrs this is a convenience. But I paid for the monthly membership and tipped these drivers well. For what? Missing dinner? No thanks. Only delivery I will do now is pizza. At least I know they will get it right."
"Very poor, delivery didn't arrive spoke to customer service and still haven't had this resolved."
"The Uber software is horrible! When it works, it's beautiful, smart and well designed. The problem is, I'd guess 40% of time I attempt to place an order I have some issue with the cart, or some new ""error message"". I hate leaving bad reviews but I cant stand uber eats anymore! Scroll down at the recent reviews people, almost ALL BAD. They reply to them all tho ""tell us more about your issue"" they should INSTEAD pay ppl to FIX THE PROBLEMS instead of apologizing for them!"
"I paid about 60$ for pho from the Vietnamese restaurant An Chi in San Francisco. When I opened the broth container, a really disgusting smell came out, and almost made me puke, and my friend had the same reaction. There was no way we were gonna eat that, so I threw everything to the trash. After more than a month of back and forth with uber eats, they offered to give me a 5$ coupon. This is a joke, and I'm deleting the app, and will use grubhub instead. Very disappointed and angry at uber eats."
Great experience!
"Good but, I am tired of having to message my exact location to my delivery guy because the won't let pin point exactly where I am located like the original Uber app does. It would really help if there was an option to do so. Also there are some options missing from certain restaurants. [Edit] I tried adding the new address but now add manually option seems to be there. I'm begining to think it's a regional thing, I live in the Dominican Republic. EDIT same problem, no following from Uber. 1 star"
Tienen gran variedad de alimentos y de gran calidad
Its Is a good app
God app nice..!
Best delivery app
Great service always. Thk u so much
"very professional service way better than otlob, I love it"
Always great
E vcd eye time I order on this app my food gets here quick and hot and I dont have to wait very long
Wen I download the app it asks for my number and password the fault is that it doesn't give u the option to register with the app and u r advertiseing it on TV and u can't even register this needs fixing 🤨 I'm not happy
"We're new to Uber eats,used them twice and every thing was hot and fresh. The food temperature and presentation was as if I'd driven it home myself. The friendly service made it a plus."
Good
Dope app
I was charged twice for the same thing!
"Way more expensive that just ordering from the restaurant themselves, major price gouge."
"Thought it was great, and easy to use, until I put my information for my location in, and it wouldn't let me put in an order for food. I hope no one actually drives out here, because I'm uninstalling this app."
"Não consigo mais pagar com tíquete refeição, simplesmente não seleciona, na hora de pagar pede pra selecionar a forma de pagamento"
Dont work
Use this app more than I should
Muinto boin so falta as loja
Complete trash
Orders sometimes get cancelled without explanation.
Nice.
Haven't gotten my order or my order was late on multiple occasions sometimes waiting several hours before they ultimately cancel my order for no real reason. I don't want a lousy $5 off 😐
"Love the app, was always super hesitant of using it but now I am just loving this especially when it has so many food options that I normally do not have near me."
Easy peasy
Excelente
This app saves my life!
Better than sending your homie w a list lol
i would rate it 100 stars if i could !!!
"Uber Eats é fácil de usar, tem boas promoções e as cumpre. Acho melhor que o ifood."
Easy to use
This is so unreal. I downloaded the app installed it and tried to register. It told me I already had an account. Funny thing is I just got this app for the first time. I sent an email to contact email address provided only to find out it doesn't work. I have no other choice but to uninstall and use a different app.
Getting better!
Great
"I love delivery from anywhere you can think of, thanks Uber"
Never receive my food I'm very upset
Someone else used my phone number. And the service who was suppose to fix it never fixed it.
Good restaurants but app crashes constantly
Good app
Love it
It is really good
Good food delivery good too.
Friendly and fast abs convenient
They stole $211 from me I will never use them again there's no card security at all and no way to remove your card from the account or to contact customer service
Okay then.
"Have been charged twice, when will this correct itself as showing up as charged on bank account. Never had this issue before. Please correct."
Have a gift amount. And can not use it. Useless .. my only options for payment are credit or pay pal..even though my 75.00 credit is listed. Unable to use. You need to fix the problem
Waited an hour and a half for a delivery slated 25 minutes. If you want faster service go with Doordash.
Worst customer experience. Food was not delivered and marked as delivered. Once marked as delivered we cannot contact customer service directly to complain and resolve. Its been over a day and I have still not heard back. Lost my money and went hungry.
It's a good app to use
Everything is good just that there is no such thing as japanese bbq coz its all korean restaurant selling korean bbq. What is japanese bbq anyways
Wrong meal delivered - left feedback with Uber eats - now what?
"No se pueden cancelar órdenes desde la app, la app es cero amigable y las opciones son muy limitadas."
I'm having a hard time to remove and old debt card from the app and I tried to log in on the website and it won't let me
Another fine creation from the white man. Thank you Sir
"Just bad. first order was cold and wrong. No way to call customer service. The restaurant blammed uber. It was a mess and no help from Uber. The app was confusing and does not allow for correction, not able to update reviews. People should not use this app. There are better."
Great
"Absolutely S**t, didnt receive all of my order and what did arrived cold, sat on the phone for 18 minutes to get through to someone for them to cut of the call, phone back finally get to speak to someone after 38 minutes of being on hold, for them to give me 12 pound all in all, baring in mind I spent 38 pounds, had a young child to feed and parents with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Disgusting service 🖕"
Lo mejor que hay en delivery
Depression enabler number one.
Aparecen promociones pero no las puedes pedir
Good
"Besides the fact they sen a guy on a bike from a far location ao the food was cold and un enjoyable, the guy made a deop off before mine so itbwas extra cold. no customer service. the order was wrong and they doule the price of everything so they extra screwed me. and never reached out to me to make things right. only sent 5 uber dollars so i use them again. guess what uber, never again will i waste my money and im gunna make sure anyone im with will now either!"
"WEN UBER IS NOT. ERGE WITH ZOMATOO THE APP IS DOING PERFECTLY WORK BUT NOW IT'S TOTALY REDICULOUS, SO I DELETED..."
"No sirven para nada, gaste 150, el repartidor nunca llego y marco mi orden como si me hubiera esperado 15 minutos, no me la entrego y uber no me quiso de volver el dinero, vuelvo a pedir vrga por aqui"
Nice
Doesn't let you placed orders without a card on file. What's the reason of the option for paying in cash if I am unable to use it? Doesn't makes sense. Glovo does and even provides better discounts for referrals
stopped working and it's a nightmare to get hold of Ubereats
food maad
Got this app because it was 2 in the morning and me and some friends wanted food so proceed to order pizza from a place that closes at 3. Make the order at 210 and am told it will arrive by 320 at the latest........ nope wasnt the case either this stupid app messed up or the lazy people at the pizza place didn't want to make the food but 3 came and all the app kept saying was food was being prepared
It feeds me occasionally.
Best food delivery service
No need to get cold n wet when the food comes to you!
Just wished when I cancel an order like really fast that I'd get my money back but other than that fabulous app
The fees are off the charts only in fees are like 11 dollars practically another meal👎🤬. Then if you want to cancel an order they keep the money and no order🤬🤬🤬🤬🤯
"It's been a while since I've ordered with ubereats but there was one place I wanted that they had. I was using the regular Uber app and it says that I chose a restaurant that's only on the ubereats app. Ugh, but fine. But then it's not in the app either. I spent 10 minutes going between both apps and the website to figure it out and nothing. They're not cheaper, so this was the only reason I had for using ubereats at all."
Shittttttyy Service
Good
Food was outstanding as usual our compliments to the chef at bella italia and to the lovely delivery man huseen very friendly and polite👍💋
"Useless service, I ordered through the app from McDonald's and the order had fries missing as well as cool drink that was half empty ( obviously spilt out) would recommend this app rather use Mr D"
"Everything fine, until we placed an order. Paid, of course, 25.5€ total. The courier said he arrived and contacted us. This never happened. We were at home, not a single message on the app neither by phone, no phone calls. The feedback? ""We cannot do anything, because the courier acted according the policy"". I am sure he did not. Not a single check, anything? He ""said"" he contacted us. I say he did not. Our money? Gone. Later update: someone offered good support in the end."
Very easy to use and just makes it a lot better
I ordered from them they have me 20 to 30 min delivery time its been over an hour and and they keep adding more time my 3 small children are upset and hungery as am i worst food app
Excellent job
Reliable and Good
Great
Shawarma is bae
She was very nice
This company pisses me off! Every order is always being delivered to the wrong address AND STOP HIRING PEOPLE TO DELIVER FOOD ON BICYCLES!!!!
Food sat for a hour while they tried to find a driver to pick it up. Arrived cold and nasty. No one wants cold breakfast!!
One of the worst food ordering app and never using it again ! Help option is worst and there is no way to contact with anyone. Plus way to expensive and don't waste your time and money.
"It robbed me of my money, charged me more than what I was supposed to pay. Rather use Mr Delivery."
Eventually got the app working. I happy now.
Very poor user flow for the log in and even poorer customer service. Contacted them because i could not log in to my account. They told me i did not have an account. But my phone number is still linked to account which they can't find because i do not have the email address. So i can not order. And they can not do anything about it.
It's very reliable and service is good
"Service client qui laisse à désirer !! J'ai passé une commande qui a été reçu à moitié , sur l'app j'ai trouvé dans la section d'aide un moyen pour déclarer le manque mais aucune réponse, ni notification que ma réclamation a été bien prise en compte , j' n'ai trouvé aucun numéro pour appeler le service client par téléphone, un jour après toujours aucune réponse !!! Je ne recommande pas !"
"The drivers take cash and say i didnt pay and this is the third time its happening, the consultants dont reply on our complains and i cant order on my app because i am owing money i dont know off and nobody seems to care or help. Most useless app with 0 customer service"
"Doesn't deliver where I'm at when it's just three blocks away can you imagine,it's mind boggling to me"
Very good
Beyond terrible!
Can't receive verification SMS
Good but should have a new section for recently added restaurants
"First few orders were fine, most recent order was completely wrong. Tried going through the help process and a day later still nothing, paid for an order I never received."
This app is great for rich people. 32 bucks for 2 burger meals at mcdonalds is just too expensive. They take a percentage of your total price instead of a basic service fee so i wont be using it often. Trash to be honest just walk to your store to save 50 percent of your money.....
You are not good in partying with zomato. Uber eats app was only good
"Easy to order, food guaranteed or money back. Excellent service provided by uber!"
Great service
Would never use again delivery driver was incompetent stay away from them
Maybe too expensive considering that restaurant who already do delivery offer this service for free themself but usefull for ordering some mcdo i guess
Wrong order delivered. Waste of £25. Still not heard back from Ubereats.
Not good my last order was very cold and I ask for ketchup there weren't any it was disappointed
"Update: Same problems even after clearing cache. I cannot order any more. It gives me an error at the bottom of the screen saying ""error fetching search location results"" when I attempt to put in my address. I have my location on, and have restarted my phone/reinstalled the app but the error persists. Will change back to 5 starts once this is fixed. - Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge"
"Very easy to use, convenient"
"App works great but customer service is non existent. There is no customer support if there are issues with the order, you are just sent a message saying sorry for your experience leave a rating for the restaurant so they can possibly improve their service. Uber dont even check that their drivers are who they say they are most of the time it will be a completely different person than who they say will deliver and the vehicle doesn't match either. 👎👎👎"
It was good untill they make a mistake and deny thier mistake and refuse a refund. Just go to zomato
"Sometimes works, sometimes let's me put everything in my basket then says ""sorry your too far away"" when I've not moved! Sort it out! It's annoying and dumb as hell. I live in a city this shouldn't be a problem."
Very easy app to use
This app is honestly the worst at resolving issues. Why does it not promo me to confirm my address? Why do I get phone calls from drivers asking me to solve a problem implicit in the app functionality? Why does this app glitch out and then refuse to admit. Even worse is that these poor drivers are beholden to no support or assistance at all from Uber. Sort your selves out Uber. You HAVE to be better than this.
time saving application
Always says cant deliver to our address yet we have had many delivered here we always have this trouble for around an hr or 2 then it decides to work.
Latest update. If ordering from McDonald's don't expect your orders to be complete. Chicken Selects for instance come as part of the menu with two dips worth £1.00. Didn't get them for the second time of ordering and Uber weren't helpful at all. Had fries/burgers and fruit bags missing from orders too but what do I expect from big companies? A good service?! Yeah right!!!

My card was compromised thru this APP. Buyer Beware.
Lovely
Fast and acvurate
Grear app to order every food
Couldn't sign up It says your account does not have a password With no options
It's amazing it does all sorts of restaurants quick delivery and fast food I definitely rate this app a 100 but a 5 out 5
👌
Really good seevice
Very good app
Great and convenient
Keeps crashing
Pretty good so far. Wish they had a card on delivery option though
Amazing service! Love this app!
It has great deals
Super
Why uber eats is not working now in Chandigarh😭😭😭😭
كسمكم
Excellent 👍
Good offer
"My order took more than an hour to arrive and there was no way to contact Uber Eats to cancel the order, the instructions given didn't work."
Exceptional. First class
😋
Cant call the driver.
This app is useless as i been trying to order for 2 hours and still it wont let me sign in
Best food delivery app
Good
Is good
"Edit: Here are details of original complaint - Anyone I speak to on any platform had ended up ignoring me and the link below was no more help [ ref:_00Do0aYry._5001JsmXeK:ref ] Had an awful order with missing and undercooked items, customer service seem to be ignoring my emails. Put in a new complaint because I was being ignored, was told it was too late for them to do anything. Do not use! Check their Facebook and see how awful they are and how unhelpful their customer services are!"
delivery fee🙄🙄
This continues to be the worst possible way to order food. Always late and a gamble if all items will be included. Often wrong items are delivered when support is contacted it takes several hours or days to receive a response which is usually copied and at best tenuously connected to the issue at hand. Actually the best way to ensure your ordering experience is as poor as possible!! Avoid at all costs and go directly to the restaurant for a better experience
Excellent
It does what it advertises.
"The app is always updated, updated to the current time. ❤️It is never wrong."
Such cool peoole
"The driver was on time food was hot. Id prefer every categorie/tabs of a restaurant to be closed until you open it by clicking on it, like in menulog. Makes it more organized instead of having to scroll down ."
"I had bad experience kast night 02/29/2020. I placed an 33$ order and they gave me an incorrect order, i didnt get my big mac. They didnt place my money back on my card. Im highly pissed. All yesterday i spent bout 100$ on uber eats. Im very upset"
Need to have a better hiring system some drivers dnt match their picture
"To my complaint below, Uber responded only to the missing food (the part of the problem that was not completely the company's fault, so enabling a driver to be penalised) but no comment about their app changing my order or calling out two different drivers for the same order, or deceptively calling it a ""past"" order to sidestep responsibility (the issues that the company cannot pass on to a driver). They'll happily admit someone else's fault (and charge a driver on low-income) but not their own"
Quite good
Food always gets here fast and hot. Reasonable prices. Big ups to Uber Eats
"The drivers need to ensure that they are delivering food to the right people, at times they are very quick to deliver without verifying and have ended up delivering to the wrong person."
"Professional, on time, fresh food, customer service on point."
Cool good food yum🍔🍕🍩🍜🍻 🍝🍛🍱🍱🍸🍹🍷🍫🍨🍧🎂🍰🍪
It's better if you can provide a picture of the meal.
It won't even let me order anything very disappointing
Actually i rsted this app 5 star before but after it is aquired by zomato. IN india i reduced it beacause when it was the separate it was very cool awesome.
Very good app
Tried loading my capitec card. It charges me R1 but refuses to load.....
"What's wrong with this app? It was working fine and suddenly it stopped loading!!!! When I uninstalled and tried to reinstall it, it wouldn't continue beyond 80%!!!!!!! Update: I finally managed to reinstall it, and when I did it worked fine. I hope it doesn't crash again or I'll get rid of it once and for all."
Saved my life
They were items missing f my order
I can't find chicken licken on my list of restaurants.This verification things...So bad
promotions work in this update! it's all good
Awesome!
Bangin' when it works? But I don't understand why the same restaurant is too far away sometimes. I also don't understand why you'd let me make an order then tell me when I go to place it that the place is too far away?? I don't like that it's really inconsistent. There's also not a lot of choice. All just burger joints.
"Orders are wrong regularly, almost every time, and because of this they now refuse to refund me. So the restaurabt messes up and i lose out. Dont bother with his app."
"The experience is bad the driver's don't call when they get lost, as a client i have to call the driver's and ask.......they don't bring nthe right orders i've ordered streetwise 1 with side breast i got a thigh..... Please make sure when a client order u bring correct things and u send a driver's who is familiar with the place....Thank you."
My order got robbed bit they don't wanna give me another one
Come with no straws and sometimes cold ok with timing
Highly sickening and disappointing app. Customer support and contact is sick!!!!!!!!
"Quit some flaws with positioning. Would be good if one could manually place the pin. Initially I rated 3 Stars but upon Uber Eats response I changed to 1 Star. How arrogant?!. Clear your Cache and see if it fixes it. NO UBER EATS. You fix the app. If i have to clean the cache everytime before I am using an app, I'd be doing nothing else than that. You provide the opportunity to do manual adjustments amd it's all fine. It's already possible on the Uber Ride share app. Just do it !"
Taste for everything
Great
Awesome
I think my wife cheating on me
Good
Easy to use
Unreliable
worst app a lot of problems needs to be fix. Im trying to order and after I order & go to the cart to order out keeps preventing me from paying out. A lot of error problems. Im not sure if its the app problem or the company's fault when atca certain time they're closing. Please fix the problems. TY.
Overcharging and not compensating for their stuff ups
Horrible Horrible Horrible There is no option to cancel orders even when you mistakenly place one or change address when you forgot to select the new address after placing an order whereas the other food delivery apps have all these functions
Its not picking up my order. And keeps saying error
Uber Eats has let us down 3 orders which we were charged and not delivered. 2 on February 21st and today. We ordered from elite and as one item was not available the order was cancelled. Now I have lost rs 1800 +1800 on the 21st Feb and 1700 todays order. I demand my cash paid back
Very easy to use.
Always getting delays on deliveries
Unable to sign on to existing account from new phone. Who does that?
I miss uber eats. It was better than Zomato for online food delivery.
Restaurants at your fingertips. Just be sure to check your orders as when its busy mix ups can happen (rarely but they do)
Good service
Good.. Late delivery
Very low quality app.Can't cancel the order? Function doesn't work properly.
Failed to create account cause it showing your number has no password
Relaxing at the couch wacthing tv
The app thats feeds me everyday 😂
Love it!
Great!
Ican't order because my account is locked
"Rarely gets orders right, and if they forget anything, which they usually do, the customer service is terrible. They most likely will get the order wrong and still charge you for things you didn't even recieve"
It is very good
Please be on estimate time as given
Exceptional
Driver refused to leave vehical
Easy to use.
"Will never use again got sick and couldn't receive my order, they canceled and still cant get my money back horrible! Out of food and money on my sick bed!"
I hate you guys got away with Zomato. 😛
Ggg
"Might be nice, if you ever actually get your food."
Wait times are not accurate. Not understanding why they have people delivering food walking. Hate it
The app is great.. Most of the food is delivered on time and the delivery fee is not much
"Think Ive finally used Uber Eats for the last time. Its got a cool idea of free delivery or something where you can order some options recently ordered and delivery is free but thats nothing compaired to the bill.. for a while I was just impulsive and placed the order and forgot, but after looking at the receipts, and matching to skip the dishes or others, they have a paragraph of fees. Not literally but 5 or 6 lines, hst, fee, delivery fee $12 or more usually. It looks disgusting and messy."
"I swear to god if I get another ""error please try again"" ima throw hands"
No food. Money taken from my account. Totally robbed. Do not use this app. You are just supplying delivery men with food. And support ignored me completely. I am disgusted
Poor
Fast and reliable
Best app when your a lazy c@#%
Do not use! they wont turn up with your order wen u finally figure out how to contact them they will offer a refund for food but not the delivery fee and the refund will never turn up either! Try deliveroo! Still no refund! Eventually got a refund over a week later and lots of complaining! Make sure u have a plan b wen ordering! I'm done with uber I hear just eat are getting macdonalds aswell!
Got charged $50 for food I didnt get because my driver didnt speak english and couldnt find us.
Is great so far.
"Rip-off prices compared to in store, even with free delivery. Very poor sorting and filtering options."
the cutosmer serivce option is not feasible and we cant cancel order if we have ordered by mistake or if we've placed the wrong order changing the items is really difficult. But I still miss uber eats and it's amazing offer.
it was good but now it's not working
"I love the app. I do hope that the drivers could start a bit earlier on weekends. If not, it's still a great app"
"Horrible experience. I ordered icecream when never ended up being delivered, then I was promised a refund. That, wasnt all that bad, mistakes happen. But then when I inquired about my refund, I was blatantly told that I cannot get me money back, and that if I pursued the subject, my account would be deactivated. I was literally threatened by a customer service team, keep in mind I was never rude or offensive."
"Delivery times never realistic, constant delays. Subpar customer service when issue with an order. Not pleased, will discontinue use and find another app."
Life saver!!!!!
"Used to be slow and had bad accuracy. It is working a lot better now, but it let me waiting for my food for hours more than once and gives no way for customers to cancel on those situations. Pretty bad service. Sadly it is basically the only option where I live. To make matters worst, their answer on those reviews seem to be automated and I couldn't reach out to them following provided instructions."
Very convenience after midnight
😊
"AWFUL customer service. Failed to deliver our order despite saying it was 2 minutes away before driver cancelled, made it difficult to get in contact with support and ultimately said well we gave you a refund so that's all. Despite that my family was left hungry for the night. They marked the complaint as resolved and while I tried to reach out saying it in fact wasn't, they blocked my message as the customer service person had it logged as resolved."
Nice
Why the hell zomato showing really pissed odf
Waste app. Download Zomato instead of uber and save 40 MB
"El envío es decente, no tiene nada de especial pero si el restaurante tarda mucho la entrega se pospone indefinidamente, respecto a reparto todo es para con el repartidor, por lo que si tiene algún inconveniente y no puede entregar la comida te quedas sin la misma. Reembolsos tardan 2-10 días contrario a la competencia que es en el momento. Deja mucho que desear"
The app is good but ive been trying to get a refund on the 25 percent off that never applied but everytime i pick the screenshot it just resets the app. Its almost 25 bucks i wont get back now
Horrible experience. So inaccurate GPS. No customer service number available.
Exellent
"The app glitch out and I ended up ordering twice as much than I wanted to. What's worse is that I couldn't cancel the order because there was no cancel button to push, where it is supposed to be."
Super
"Used this 4 times and not got a single bit of grub. Only used it bcos of promotions but either been cancelled (once the foods prepared with the restaurant), or just said it was out for delivery and never showed. Complete waste of money. Customer service doesn't exist, don't bother"
"This app is great i tried it for the first time today and didn't have any issues logging in,loading or placing my order. What i like about Uber is seeing where the driver is so you know when he or she arrives. 👍"
I love uber eats 😍
If I could give less than 1 star I would. They were awful at giving us the right order. Dislike them and don't use this. Go with door dash. Much better and they actually give you want you order. Uber eats sucks
"The worst food delivery experience I have ever experienced from any product around the world. Our driver went to the wrong address, corrected us on where we lived, and wouldn't deliver our food. We called customer service, which refused to refund their mistake. Our food came an hour late, cold. Do not use Uber Eats."
Good
"I d rather walk on glass barefoot 10 miles to pick up my food than to ever download this ripoff app. If you're lucky enough to afford their ridiculous fees they'll either mess up the order, the driver eats your fries, or they bring cold food. If you cancel before they start to prepare it, uber cheats claims you wont be charged. Lied. When you call to complain, they admit that the order was canceled quickly n they will reimburse the $32 within 5 days max. Another lie. Received $0 in 10 days"
Too expensive what would be a 20 order ends up being 50 not rich enough in this time and age to afford such a luxuary
Works great
we are missing you. love from India
Sometimes the app will close on me while I'm using it. I am also prohibited from ordering at certain places even though the restaurant was a suggestion.
"I just ordered a food in uber eats. When rider came with my food i gave him full money what he wanted and what uber apps showed. After that, when i ordered food via uber eats next time, uber rider said i have a charge added which is added from my previous order. But In previous order i already paid full payment. uber apps want me to pay double money for the same order. that is very bad."
Couldn't update my order. So it was cancled. Kinda dumb
App constantly gives me issues... Thanks for the computer generated response.
Still not available around Dandenong?
"The store where i wanna order from is ""too far"" when its only 10 min away and now i can't order food....this is why doordash is better"
Location should update automatically
Needs a way to add items after checkout if you forget something. Customer support (Damien) was unhelpful and slightly rude when asked how to add some fries.
Ok
My uber cash has suddenly disappeared. I tried to use the money towards a meal and it didnt work so I figured I would use it on my next order and so I went to use it and it was gone.
"Only 4 due to the high cost of delivery fees out here. Otherwise, great app!"
Awesome and fast service
Food was delish
App is fixed (it was my own stupidity)🤣
Expensive lol but good service most times
Cool
"I placed my address in the app , then was charged for my meal. Then told that they wouldnt able to deliver to me bc i was out of the area"
not bad
Not as expected when you are in the Restaurant.
Great App
"Hardly any selection, and the few places i like that they have are ""out of range"" dispite it being on my front page. GrubHub deliverers their food."
Is working very poorly
Slow service and dumb ass service charge
Literally ordered food and been waiting hours. Not paying for this either.
Good
"Never recieved order as I waited expecting delivery at estimated arrival. No one called me about canceling the order, and I am hungry!!"
Needs more free rides but great app ok drivers love it
"Constant lag in app, difficulty applying gift cards, etc."
Nah
Awesome!
Couldn't be bothered to deliver my order. Ordered from two places and waited 3 hours for a delivery driver who never came. What is the point!
Great food
On time
My trip price doesnt show in my drivers phone and my app also says as credit
Is nice app
Yummy
"Muy mal servicio, y no solo de los locales de comida sino que también de la app."
Isn't working App no good
Driver stole my food. Horrible experience
I ordered food from Tavo Bell by my work... And they kerp changing the time from 8 pm to 8:40 p.m. and we are hungry
I never get email promos but I love the app.
"Near impossible to change address, whether in app or with the delivery driver, since none of them speak the local language."
"App is user friendly, however uber recently raised all of their additional charges so considering using other services"
Buyer beware their address detection is by far the most outdated thing there is. And if the driver waits for you at a wrong address by applications design he can choose to call the delivery as complete and waltz off with your order leaving without your hard earned money or food to eat. I had to explain to every single driver how to get to the destination on multiple ocasions because the app simply doesn't work like the original Uber app. Such a disappointment.
I got offered a promo for first time use and said it expired even though it was still in date . Made me waste my time will be be looking to other food service apps
Can't filter search results.
"Poor reliability in food quality, missing items with no way to remedy the situation and zero customer service!"
I would have given 5 stars untill the driver took off with my order this morning!! He marked it off as received and didnt come!! Im so discusted!! He should get sacked!!
Lame
I love this app. Very useful and accurate!
They are efficient and more cost effective
Very good
Order cancel button is not appearing 😠😠😠
NOTHING WORKS!
Good app but for some reason i cant add my home address
Need Lower prices and better partners needed. Service fee too high since already a delivery fee. Top performers should be on the top of recos..not just the deals
Food isn't what's on the menu
I have used this app three times to deliver food to my 93 year old mother at the nursing home and it has been a massive headache every time. It would be easier to drive out order the food and wait for it to be prepared and then drive it to my mother than to do this. If a restaurant has two locations the app always defaults to the wrong restaurant. She is in a nursing home that is well known but the drivers always get lost. What a mess. Just uninstalled the app and will try a competitor now.
Cool apo uber eats
Most times it doesn't work for me. My order won't go through
The restaurant gives no utensils and no sauce.
Dammm good..!!
"No support at all. If anything wrong happens, you have to read a bunch of useless articles, which helps nothing at all. However, basically every order goes wrong"
It would nice if it were easier to remove items from the cart.
Not functioning.
"Pretty good I like the easy accessibility to correct problems immediately, that's why I stay loyal."
"Very convenient for Me. Sometimes I'm to busy or tired to prepare a meal after a long day of work. Delivery times are excellent, and the drivers are courteous!"
Very expensive
Absolute scam. Over charged and sent the wrong order. I was refused a refund. Had to throw away the food. Don't download this app!!
"Ordered an order and after 10 min , they cancelled it with no reason. After a month a made a new order , and i surprised that they want me to pay the amount of the cancelled order receipt, claiming that they can't refund me this amount as the order was made more than 10 days ago. Is that a reason to collect an amount of money Unjustly ? I didn't what you asked me to do and nothing happened !!"
The service itself isn't perfect but it gets the job done
"Sick of late orders. Don't tell me delivery will be in 20-30 minutes, then on the confirmation page say the latest delivery time will be 45 minutes later, and give me no possibility to contact anyone or cancel the order. Then when food hasn't turned up after an hour tell me you'll just duplicate the order. If the food does turn up it's often freezing."
Fast and best thing in Ballarat
Atrocious customer service.
The app has picked a restaurant location that is further away when there is one closer. The customer service rep told me I should confirm that the app has chosen the closest location through Google. Seriously?! I repeated what the rep said back to her and confirmed what she was saying. Go figure.
👍🏾😁
Pretty Aight
Great app. As easy to use as the car service.
Never order L&B pizza from uber eats the DELIVERY GUY deliverS ON A BIKE MY PIZZA CAME COLD AND HARD IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE FROZEN PIZZA FROM THE SUPERMARKET YOU HAVE TO HEAT UP
Terrible!
Papa isn't in the house. Nuff said.
Very pleased so far. 02/29/2020 This is an update to let you know that it has been wonderful to use. I am impressed with the choices of Restaurants available to me. Keep adding more.
Excelente. Buenas opciones para comer y el servicio es rapido
Nice!
Happy
"Amo, uso sempre!!!"
"Terrible app. I have placed multiple orders that have taken well over an hour to assign a delivery person and then just end up being cancelled. I have called customer support and they have always been absolutely useless. Dont bother with this app unless you want to wait over an hour for food, get frustrated and angry, and end up with no food for your troubles. Ridiculous. Stick with door dash."
Te cancelan las ordenes sin reembolso por tranzas de los repartidores
Awesome
Crashes consistently
Update is terrible. Was working fine before
Very good . I had to call for help. She was very helpful.
"Bums on a Bike. Now using bikes in non-downtown areas. Uber doesn't even left you know or give you the option of choosing a bike. Food took 20m longer than usual, was cold, drinks spilled all over. Will never use Uber Eats again. So many times they change how your food is delivered and don't have the decency to let you know."
First time user
Very good
I've only used it twice but so far I'm very pleased there quick efficient friendly courteous and reasonably priced
Very nice
Delivery could b a little faster so the food is warmer
Great variety and fast service
You guys did a great service and disservice when you sold out to your competitors here in India.
They cancel orders then not refund you. They havent helped me either. Im done. Terrible. Im sorry the drivers have to deal with them.
Great app
All Customer service have their problems but I can say Uber customer service is fine. And i love their services.
Love it 😍
I like the app but hv dnayed me chance to order food
Every time I order from KFC the order is wrong and we have to go back to KFC to get our right order
Nunca funciona os cumpons que mandam por email. Que propaganda enganosa!!!!
Superb service
"Tried multiple times to install, fails each time"
Upon opening app I always have to enter my address and then nothing happens... rubbish
"Twice in a row now orders have arrived with items missing. 3 items today and cold items today and other days. Wanted the missing items delivered but only given the option of refund. I don't want to order again because it will amount to £7 delivery + tip which I always give. Uber's response, call the restaurant after you order. So, what is the point of using Uber if I have to call the restaurant afterwards anyway? Uninstalling now and will stick to Just Eat or direct ordering 😤"
We placed an order but the Uber rider never showed up. He kept calling but he doesn't speak English or French. We ended up with no food and Uber charged us for the food and delivery. This is ridiculous
Yaman
Not available in all area in dhaka city. Poor service....
"Our household ordered with Ubereats three times, was a totally frustrating experience twice. Ordered with deliveroo many times and never had a similar issue. Most outrageous: had to pick up our order ourselves because ubereats delivered only half the order. Wrote a complaint email, never heard back. After following up we were told that they can't do anything about it because more than 10 days had passed. Great customer service..."
Good app
No option to log in.
Perfect and fast
Give me free food
Always convenient and easy to use
Not well at all up to now I've ordered twice both times cold food. Charges £3.50 for delivery and sends it by bicycle I can't believe it ofcourse it will get cold by the time it gets to customer
Difficult to use and lack of customer service
Filters don't work. Chooses BBQ and got 80 restaurant most not related to BBQ such as Pizza restaurant. So giving up and Apt disconnects. S
"Ubereats monroe Washington is a complete joke! Waiting over an hour for McDonald's? I've ordered through here 3 times and only ONCE I received my order. If you don't have enough drivers or responsible ones, THEN DONT RUN YOUR BUSINESS IN THE TOWN/CITY! PLUS THEY DON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY. THEY OFFER YOU FREE DELIVERY WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE.... COMPLETE JOKE AND WASTE. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH HERE"
Excellent service and delivery by a very dedicated man Abdul.
"I ordered a standard Kfc meal from an outlet 15min away. My order was delayed from 30min to 1h30min, then my order was cancelled without any reason given."
Useless delivery never arrived but was charged and there is no respsonsive customer service! Use Just eat tried and tested
Simple chicken sandwich and fries from McDonald's was almost an hour later. It got switched from one driver to another.
Exelent service
"I can't get into my account, and it's not letting me put an email I use"
Good
"Great, fast , and easy"
Customer service is a joke. I use this app all the time . I'm going back to Door dash.
"I lost access to my email, got hacked. I cannot recover my account, even though the only way to sign up is with my phone number. Despite proof, I cannot drive or use Ubereats or anything uber. It sucks. If I can verify my phone & other info, I should be able to switch my email. I've had to give Lyft, doordash, instacart etc my business, because I can't use uber. I used Uber a lot too smh"
Entered my address and it said they would be on their way and I didn't even choose what I wanted
Useful app
"WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS APP! If I could rate it less I would. Customer experience so far has been horrendous and they allow sub par vendors and then insult the customer when we pointed out there was an issue! UPDATE: On my second use of this app, after spending £35 on a meal that arrived inedible and trying to inform the customer service department that one of their vendors was not delivering the food of a good enough quality I have been informed I am apparently committing consumer fraud."
"Really good fast, when it works. Otherwise, the app is a buggy mess that constantly gets ""server errors."""
Amazing thank you
Love it!!
Their app design isn't the most useful or well organized. Canceling orders or changing address is a chore.
Good
You know what it is
People can't give people they food
👍 works perfectly!
It's always good even if the orders been sent wrong
Nice
Got a great deal - essentially free food. Yum!
Waited 2hrs for order and then order was cancelled wont be using again
"Too bad its just too complicated to view and edit orders if needed. ok, here's the feedback: after placing the order, it's just impossible to edit. I needed to change local of delivery...forget it. Also I needed to add more items (from the same place i was ordering from)...forget it. I tried this imediatly after placing the order so the guys at the restaurant could perfectly modify the order. Also: why I tried to change the delivery local? because the uber gps can't get my address location right. I would be so simple to correct it...it's only 20 meters after all..."
First class
Very bad service
Great keep up the good work.
Excellent
"Every time I order it comes incorrect and Uber only offer a partial refund or none at all saying this sometimes happens, this is their response "" Thanks for reaching out We've taken a look into your order and the concerns you've raised and unfortunately, we will be unable to provide a refund on this occasion. We understand that these issues do arise on occasion, but not often at this regularity."
Uber support are no good at supporting people
Cancelled my order without letting me know. No contact information to call ubereats to have the issue resolved
Great!
Food is always on time and delicious drivers always friendly
"I'm so disgusted with the food that I received I threw it in the the bin not knowing how the app worked phone the lady at the shop hagley road West and she told how to go about it's, but obviously too late, spent £22:98 on a meal chips were cold the beans were hot and the chicken was horrible the skin was hanging off and looked like an old sock, the bottom of the box was full of oil , tried one piece and it made me sick , it arrived on time but was terrable , I'm disabled and can't get out !!!!"
Bad install
Great for lunch time at work!
"Customer service sucks. I spent almost $50 dollars for Starbucks. An item was missing, reported it, thinking that, like their competitors, they would offer some type of refund. Was told that I was issued a refund, have not, let them know and was told that they are not ""in a position to offer a price adjustment or compensation"" . NEVER ORDERING OFF OF UBER EATS AGAIN."
Order took 2 hours to get here
O aplicativo comete muitos erros que para resolver precisa enviar e-mails para resolver Seria mais simples um suporte tecnico que resolvese antes que a avontade de comer acabese em frustracao. O aplicativo deveria oferecer uma lista de comercios cadastrados mais proximos do cliente Assim poderiamos fazer pedidos de estabelecimentos que ja conhecemos e confiamos.oque tambem ajudaria na rapidez da entrega. Passei mais de meia hora tentando fazer um pedido de um acai e nao consegui perca de temp
Why is your delivery charge so much?
FRUSTRATING!!! I HAVE AN EXISTING UBER EATS ACCOUNT HOWEVER I HAVE A NEW PHONE NUMBER SO I DOWNLOADED THE APP ON MY NEW PHONE AND THERE IS NO OPTION FOR EXISTING USERS IT WANTS ME TO REGISTER ALL OVER AGAIN HOWEVER MY EMAIL ADDRESS HAS ALREADY BEEN USED AND THE APP WONT LET ME GO ANY FURTHER I HATE THIS APP AND ILL BE DELETING MY UBER EATS ACCOUNT 😡
The best app ever
Interface is worse than Postmates easily allows for you to order to the incorrect location- terrible customer service afterwards. Removed app.
I ordered from McDonald's and it say it was on the way the driver was 2 mins away then that turned into a hr and then never it said she was in my apt but when I called and text nobody answered I spent 18 dollars and uber only sent 6 dollarsto my uber account which came off my bank card I'm upset I didnt get my food nor my full refund back uber eats sucks
Most probably the best app for food in sri lanka
Love the app..Delivery is great when there are drivers available otherwise be prepared for a 45mn order to take double the time.Other than that app is great!
Bad app because it say's R10 delivery even if it is close
Charging more now we have to order minimum $15 wow and they charge a fee plus txs really!!!! It ends up to $20 just to have a lunch everything else as off reembursing you their really good on that area. Need it to go down uber at least $10 again i was a your #1 client i used to order uber eats 24/7 now its just 1 or twice a week.
"I dnt get my favorite restaurant, says unavailable, they said on their end it's open..."
"DO NOT USE UBER EATS. They took my payment twice. Once on day of purchase and then again 6 days later they went in to my bank account and took the amount again. When I called and talked with them they said the first amount was just a ""hold"" and that the the second payment should be returned to me. It was not returned to me. They are not responding to my emails now. EDIT THE RESPONDED TO THIS SAYING THE HAVE DEALT WITH MY ISSUE BUT THEY HAVE NOT. I HAVE NOT RECIEVED MY MONEY BACK AT ALL."
Always get what I'm looking for
"Good but could be better! You need to be able to see what other peoppe have said about the ratings on each item. Also please dont lie about delivery costs, certain big companies are charging a high rate regardless of how close or far you live!"
"Good app, good service"
Very excellent...i can refer the app to anyone who needs good servicr
I can not even order any food from this app...as they don't deliver in the area I live in which is very very disappointing. I would appreciate it if they could deliver in my area.
"Always late, always cold"
App freezes and the tracking is broken
"Easy app, food delivered straight to your door that you can track all the way.... perfect"
Love it.
I got a new phone and new number. Cant get to my account because the app says my email address is already being used. Im not getting a new email just to order from them when I can just use another app. Customer service didnt help at all. Deleting the app.
Cannot sign in because i have an account already and you apparently can only sign up not in
Excellent app
"It's quick and reliable, lots of options and discounts every now and then. I've had problems with items missing or wrong order delivered but it serves its purpose. We have a family member that is bed ridden and this app has been a big help."
Worst app everrr💩 Do not download it...... misss behavior
I found a condom from inside the food box 😠
Nice app to get food at door
Great
Good
Goooood
Flawless and reliable
"I usually love this app, but can't order anything because of server error. Please fix"
Great experience
Good app
Very poor service and I'll never use again
ابلكيشن سيء وعروضهم نصب وبيضحكو عالناس
Keeps not responding!!
"It's ok, but very inconsistent with recommendations, one minute McDonald's is too far away then it isn't? Yet I've previously managed to order from here before!"
Bad service. I have waited the order for 3.5 hours then it marked as arrived in the app and I charged money for nothing. No customer service to reply my issue.
Worthy so far
Love it!
Bad experience. Paid my order by cash but when I try to place an order again the previous one does not reflect as paid
Pésimo servicio al cliente Tuve un problema con un pedido debido a que no se siguio una instruccion en mi orden por que a que soy alérgico a la lactosa. Y su respuesta básicamente que si no se mando bien mi orden y no les importo. Sino uniera revisado mis alimentos antes de comerlos uniera tenido un gran problema.
Awesome
I think it's a little complicated especially with the discounts. Need a more simplified app.
"App itself is OK but quality assurance and customer support is abysmal. If they get your order wrong, you get a slow refund eventually and they will not send you out correct food. You're stuck with what you've got. Hope you don't have a food allergy to whatever they brought you instead of what you ordered."
The items on the menus do not have descriptions of what is in on or on the dish. So I have to go to the actual restaurant's website to first see what it consists of and then go back to Uber Eats App before I can order. Fixing that will make my rating 5 Stars.
My experience with uber eats was terrible....i paid over $50 and didnt even recieve half of my order...they only sent one item and i cant get any support
"Will not let me login, says that I have to ""register"" even though I have an account"
"Unprofessional drivers, late delivery and worst customer service. Not recommended."
"App keeps freezing, boots me out mid order and keeps saying 'Error Loading'"
I'm not able to access the app I can't get past getting my number email address and it says it's already established okay if it is then why is there no area where I can sign in I cannot access the app it will not let me use it
Why it is difficult to reseat once password
"They give you wrong orders, sometimes they don't deliver at all and just take the money. And worst is they tell you they will refund the money but never give it back"
Fast..nice love it
Bad
Good app
Very well designed app.
Its good but buggy at times.
Driver was on time
Good
Awesome food
Great
It was pretty good no complaints here but i would there to be more promos
"Best app for food delivery, but very limited choices still"
Convienient a f
Happy to report that I am greatly pleased with the services provided by Uber Eats and impressed by the compassionate way in which they resolve unpredictable order issues. Love you Uber Eats! Thanks guys!
"Love this App, but the Delivery Fees are Expensive!"
Unreliable regarding which foods you can get; also inaccurate. Can't order from the 24-hour McDonald's which is only a few km's away.
Uber eats will cancel your order without a refund or delivery of your food.
PAREM DE MANDAR NOTIFICAÇÃO!!!! NÃO TEM NO MEU ENDEREÇO ENTÃO NÃO ME INTERESSA!!!!!!!!
Works well.
Buenisisiisma
I install myself through the delegate of delivery for the orders of the orders and take it to him either because you are a quorum company and there is no order from the foundation and from yesterday you do not continue with me a little failed a thief شركة نصابه قمت بطلب أوردر وتم خصم المبلغ من الفيزا وظهر ان الاوردر اتوصل على الابليكيشن ومافيش حاجة اتوصلت وخدمه عملاء فاشله ومش عارف اتواصل مع حد او أبلغ شكوى على الميل
Great
Payment method not authorised. When you ring up they advise you to re download the app. Still doesn't work
"Better service,carry on..."
I love how they send you discounts 😍
deliveries are fast and correct i wil increase my rating to 5 if they delivered Mc'donalds to my adress...which im not even finding on the app?
We Ordered Our food at 12:01am and waited 1 hour and 25 minutes just to get a driver than waited about 40 minutes after just to recieve our food. There was no one we could call or Anything. Then you can only rate the driver when the issue isnt the driver. I'm sorry for you Uber Eat Fans but i will not be ordering with this Company anymore!
Excellent
App is great just some of the restaurants
Ridículo esse App. No cadastro inicial pede pra eu colocar uma senha para login. sendo que nem conta tenho ainda.
Great App
Nice but . . ......... .. . . . . . .. ..........
Smart
"They cancel orders when ever they want , after charging my card and Making me wait for more than an hour they simply canceled my order , they wasted my time money and left me hungry . They are over priced if you went to the restaurants and ordered the same food you will pay much less , then they also add delivery fees . I don't recommend this Survice or app in Saudi Arabia at all."
"I loved uber eats. But now as it is acquired by zomato, i cannot find my favorite resturants. I always hated zomato for over pricing, uber eats was a better option. Now I will wait for another good app to show up."
Worst app ever. Completely useless.
Everytime I download it has me text a random number start. When I try to get into uber eats it wont let me do anything. Really annoying. Now I'll be using door dash.
Great
"Uber eats is a type of app that wants you to enter all the details while sign up after adding details, when you are finished redirects to zomato. If i needed zomato then why should i have installed your app. Wow, every time i use this app it always waste my time.👎 The Uber team should check this before posting on play store."
You are Great..Keep it up...😂😂
"So much lost money on incoorect and never recived items, with very little help resoving these issues"
"I was enjoying this service for the last year until recently. I had same restaurant miss food 3 times that was fixed, another example 1 sent porridge in a Starbucks take away cup, stale & bland. I fixed that also. But now I sent a delivery to a friend & she left the house as driver arrived, so bad timing, however, long story short, instead of him cancelling order, status said order Delivered and charged me £42 for an order that wasn't delivered.This is falsified information uber refuse to comply"
We want you back india zomato is being very expensive
Worest application Worest service Worest delivery person
Perfect !
3+ серьезно?
Wonderful app ...always good everytime keep it up
Spent over 2 hours trying to order food what a pain. I ended up going for it myself 👎
App keeps freezing on me. Have not been able to receive any of my attempted orders so far.
It takes longer than its suposed to
All good.. Works as it should
There are server issues
"Store cancelled my order with no notice after it was supposed to be delivered, no note or reason, just didn't feel like filling a bigger order leaving me scrambling to get my guests breakfast after I scheduled it hours in advance. Uninstalled. App seems ok but need better feedback system. Require a reason from store when they cancel."
Very Very bad app
"Ive just had food delivered and half of it was missing, puts you off using uber for food 😡😡"
"Good, but need more discount."
Can't get to the become a driver part
"Worst service ever! Don't use this app because you will wait over 2 hours and still receive no service. Customer support is very unhelpful and responds with automated messages. Very bad delivery service, definitely won't recommend it to anyone!"
Uber eats acquired by zomato is a bad deal
Awesome
Good
Quick and easy.
"Good service, happy me."
"Really bad customer service. I had a complain regarding the quality of an order and they just replied that is the problem of the restaurant, not them. No compensation whatsoever, over priced items, no utensils even thought I ask specifically for them, portion was infimate, shells and legs found within the food. Uninstalling the app."
"The app's localisation capability needs improvement. Otherwise, good."
Love how my food is packed and care for and fast delivery service 100 stars
App froze and showed order did not complete. Ended up with a double order spoke to the help desk was just told nothing they can do. Uber respond with just another generic response. No offer of refund for the double order. App is good when it works but when it goes wrong customer service is just a robot
One of the best food delivery apps out there with their free delivery promotions and great customer service
Why this app has been closed in Hyderabad india
good
Very bad experience using app
Always late or mess up my order
Easy to use
"Waited for 45 mins, and they canceled the order with 3 mins to deliver. Reason given rider's phone got stuck. Highly unreliable app."
Who doesn't love good at your door
"When i enter my mobile number after installation, it says Password of This Account Does not Exist. Plz help"
The worst delivery app ever they should let you confirm your location befire you place the order its the second time this happens when I order food and then I forgot to change my location.
So far so good 🙂
"Good concept. The app is absolute garbage. Have reinstalled app and reset phone, and the last 5 times I've tried to order it has issues."
"No sign in button , only register and it says email exists..so how do I sign it?? Can't because there's none."
They raised the delivery fee. This makes it that much harder to get services from them. Wrong move
It closed in India 😥 got sold to zomato
First time ordering waited a hour to be told cancelled. Disgusting service Terrible AVOID at all costs
Easy to navigate
I love ubereats
"No way to contact driver. It's a delivery service. It makes no sense. You have to call customer service and they contact driver I dont understand why they wouldnt have a way to contact driver personally. My driver went next door on accident and I couldn't contact him and it was too late once customer service contacted him. He wouldn't answer. Answer to your response..no, there's nothing you can do I'm too scared to order through uber eats now!!"
Great
Lost 75 ZAR on my first order due to an error message and support is useless. I deactivated my account.
I'm facing problems with logging in. It's saying something went wrong again and again and won't let me login
Easy to use
Easy order and delivery on time.
The app is dope. When the delivery guy doesnt find you he must have a number you call he must safe keep the product at the store then when you call him again must deliver with extra cash delivery sort of penalty instead of forfeiting the entire product and money. Uber must improve this..
Love the car tracking.
Pleasant so far
Card type not accepted?! After I had quite the order ready to go.. Card type not accepted. Visa not good enough for ya?!!! Thanks a ton...???
Mediocre at best. Times are always wrong. Not recommend if ordering for your lunch time at work. Even if you order ahead of time...
Pizza
Mostly been good but has it flaws! They do fix the mistakes but it does not help you at that moment in time.
It is linking to zomato! What
Convenient and trendy
Overpriced AF
Great
"Very helpful service until something goes wrong. Drivers are generally reliable and friendly, but customer service is a disaster. Had my meal delivered completely wrong and waited 40 mins past the estimated ""Latest Delivery"" quote. I just wanted to have the proper meal sent to made no request for reimbursement. I was told I would be fully charged for the incorrect order as well as the 2nd attempt order. I was given a $5 credit for my next order. Pitiful customer service."
This app is good when you are too lethargic to leave home to get food.
Doesn't accept my orders
I am having trouble signing in
Awesome
Gud app
Nice
Cheapest delivery app in the game. Thxs uber eats
More expensive than doordash
"Too many service fees and delivery fees. all these extra fees with taxes is all too much, especially if the driver isn't seeing a penny of it; because they still expect to see a tip. The $10 meal turns into $30."
Excellent
They like to blame the user if meals turn up incorrectly too many times if the order is wrong or they give you someone else's order and you complain they then suspend your account saying you request too many refunds. Over all the years I have used the app I have 4 orders over a 2 month period turn up missing items or a drink turn up with no lid even after providing photos apparently it was me wrong not the supplier. Cheers uber for reminding me to rate the app I can no longer use :)
My food was cold two days in a row
App sucks
"Got a new number and now it won't let me login, because I don't have the pswrd of who ever had this number before me"
It doesn't deliver to me by meters literally 50 meters away it delivers but not to us
Late then chaned my time to later. But my money wasnt late never again.
Reliable but sometimes the food is late
"Love it, simple straight forward easy"
Perfect
Awesome app
Great app bestvapp on the planet i love you sophie quinn marie
good
The amount of fees is ridiculous.
"I had the worst experience, you order and food never arrived, and it happens more often than you think. Please dont use this app, there are good alternatives out there, ones you can trust. Appalling service."
❤❤❤❤
"Great app, works perfectly. The translate function has been very helpful for me."
I was impressed. Very friendly and professional. We ordered Burger King and the food was still hot! 💖
"Placed order on the 11th of February, with payment I had a R 48.20 credit. Placed order on the 28th of February and credit to the account not available, meaning Uber stole money."
"Update descriptions always say that they're making the app ""faster"", but it always seems the same speed to me 🤨"
Too expensive now
So good
Overpriced
Our delivery driver was efficient and prompt but I feel like Uber eats costs a lot more than Postmates or door dash. Just my opinion and the GPS tracker is off by a lot.
Good customer support
Better hope there is not a mistake (made by uber incidentally ) because they charge you first when they shouldnt and there is nobody to contact to get it fixed. No one or way to contact. I should of been patient they refunded my money with no debate. They totally fixed it!. Its a bummer there is no way to directly contact them. So just be patient they are committed to making there customers happy.
"Overpricing, I understand delivery fee But ubereats wanted to charged me a delivery fee for each pizza I wanted 5 simple cheese pizzas, From a Domino's 3 kilometres away. The pizzas were on special 4 dollars each, that would of been $20 for 5 pizzas pick up $30 by Domino's instore delivery service. What did Ubereats want? $15 per pizza plus an $8 delivery fee. For a total of $83 for 5 cheese pizzas from Domino's. Whoever accepts that sort of highway robber needs their head checked."
🤟👍
Great service
It was good good app why you have stop your service
Good service.
Love the app but wish I could request the delivery person.
I'm not a big fan of being punished by not getting a full refund because I couldn't get a delivery driver.
"I had the the wrost experience with Uber Eats. No one was able to support me when I called custumer service, and they didn't gave me my money back form the order I never received. I'm never using this app again. 👎"
Good app so far
Terrible service in Brazil...don't use the app here in Sao Paulo
Not letting me delete my account or letting me remove my credit card info. Nice.
GREAT
Great!!!! Really fast
No refund if food isn't delivered
Great!
Got our food on time. Driver was very helpful.
Delivery options are good. 3 star because I can't delete my card details (I have more than one card listed). The menu (three dots) only show momentarily when I try going going into split screen mode. I tap and it just sends me back. I have tried so many times.
They finally add better restaurants
"Just like everyone else, any issue with an order is met with a canned response and you are told to leave a bad review for the restaurant so they can ""do better"". What was once a quality, convenient experience is now just more fees and inconveniences."
Of you like food YES 😉
Incredible application. Needs option to add condiments
"When it works, it works. When it doesn't work, it's a disaster of unqualified proportions."
"I have ordered a kebab and it never arrived but in the app it says order has been delivered. The delivery driver didn't even called me or text me. When i mailed uber support they claimed driver called me and texted me, Actually in real he didn't. So uber made this point to decline the refund for me. In reply i asked uber to provide me the evidence of driver contacting me to which uber has failed to provide any info."
great choices and amazing timing.
Not in my area apparently but you have to fill out everything before they tell you
Great app fast and reliable food service
"Very good. They have so many options, the drivers are respectful. A+"
Sempre bugando os cartões de crédito no pedido...
"Broken app, resetting password doesn't work and loads a blank page after 'setting' new password, struggles to find your location after ""continuing"".. Don't uninstall this and then re-install after a while. You will have issues."
Great app
Horrible delivery drivers call they do not look for your address they just leave without any try I just lost 30 bucks because the delivery persons are incompetent and lazy I WILL NEVER USE UBER EATS AGAIN THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
This is amazing and convenient. I like it.
"Its quick, convenient and easy so I can order food while cramming for Mid Terms or not having to leave the house."
"Nice interface, tag system needs work"
"Cobrou a entrega, mesmo com cupom de entrega gratis aplicado"
I'm never dissatisfied.
Very reliable and variety of restaurants to choose from. Easy to use and order.
Excellent
This is a great service and i enjoy it
Mint
Fast and simple to order
Good
Súper good
app is broken. everytime i try to order something it says server error. update: tried the website and told me my card wasnt accepted even though ive been using it this whole time??? im uninstalling this useless app update: they fixed the issues i was having . 4 stars only because the delivery fees are high. update #3: they removed the free delivery options smh that was the best part about ubereats! now this app is being rated 2 stars
"Isn't working, won't load"
Great job
Awesome!
Order canceled by someone without explanation. App itself has issues with weird behavior. Not ready for use.
"I've been a loyal customer since the service was introduced. However, the way customer service deals with delivery issues is both dismissive and at times passive aggressive. At this point I bid adieu to ubereats"
Good
Good
Trash. You cant even access your account if you get a new number or new card. Just stupid.
"Problemas con los pagos, te dan error y cuando menos lo esperas, te llega la comida. Mal soporte técnico."
"Drivers sometimes steal your food, like the whole ordrr, but only a few and if you call, they will punish them. Pretty good service, usually nice people"
Great
It is easy placing an order and they always deliver on time and they never messed up orders☺
reasonable
"App is great, only thing that sucks is that I cannot use my credit card and have to pay for everything cash 🙃"
Used it once and the driver never picked up my food what a joke
Absolutely disgusted with the handling of a refund due for a restaurant leaving food out. Order every single week from Uber eats. Never again. Terrible customer service. I now have to go in person to get a cash refund from the restaurant at least the restaurant has customer service.
"The app keeps crashing. Won't let me order anything before it crashes. Doing the same thing on my wife's phone. Most restaurants seem to only work on the app, so you can't even use a browser."
This app besides the fact that Uber does recognize my address always sends the driver somewhere else and when you call.the calm center in mx they are condescending
Less expensive than other delivery services. Great service
A lot of technical issues👎👎👎
The worst experience I've ever seen with a delivery. After 3 hours they cancelled my order without saying anything. Uninstalling.
Efficient service
Decent delivery time with very good driver tracking. Great restaurant selection.
Food
App is consistently not connecting to server
Constant server errors. And it seems those errors only occur when you place an order with a restaurant you like the most or use the most often. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work. I'm pretty sick of this app. This app is nowhere near reliable as they claim. Ready to uninstall for good
meu pedido foi feito enquanto tentava usar um cupom e nai foi possivel cancelar
How does it take over an hour to make and deliver two smoothies?!?!
Was a bit difficult to navigate on the first order.
It good but right now it's not working
"Zero. Péssimo, mentiroso FAKE . Te prometem 100% de desconto na sua primeira compra, mas é MENTIRA MENTIRA MENTIRA, nunca dá certo e, ainda dizem que não dá certo porque você os deve , O QUE, Uber eats? Deixem de ser canalhas. Lixo total"
Good overall just tired of it not working as it loads
Amazing
Get for lazy days with all these kids
Awesome
Stupid driver delivery to the wrong address then told me to wait 3-5 business days to get my refund! NONSENSE!!
"First order, already messed up; missing two items. The process to get assistance with the issue is ridiculous, because it doesn't include the possibility of actually receiving said missing items. Most to hope for is a refund which takes six (!) days, in this technological age. I definitely won't be using this again."
Great
Nice
I think you should add Wendy's on here. Grubbing takes 4 hour to bring the food and when the food gets to us it's either cold as ice or something is missing. There is always a mistake with them and instead of fixing the problem with the driver they just send the money back..
"Ordered expecting uber eats to be over priced delivery, but was impressed at how cheap it was and how professional the delivery was. 10/10 would recommend and will be using again."
Great app!
Really helpful
The ice cream Was all melted and driver didnt even bother to deliver it to my door i had to send my husband to pick it up.
Poor
Uber eats promo not working and no option to get support with it.
It was fast delivery
Awesomely Good. Abso-freakin'-lutely will recommend it.
This combining orders thing is really frustrating. You end up waiting forever for your order. My order got cancelled adter being told by the restaurant that it was already picked up and you send a message through the help tab and still no one responds. I'm becoming more disappointed and more than likely will have to take my business elsewhere if it continues.
Exelente
"Too many cancellations and wrong orders, kinda not worth it. You get your actual order about 2 out of three times. :/ and the price is inflated every time."
Absouletly bullcrap. The people working at uber eats are complete bastards. I entered my promo card and it said it apllied. But when we ordered are meal ot didnt let us cancel it. The order came late and we didnt even get r discount even though it was applied. If i contact uber eats and they dare to not give me my money back im taking them to court for 419.
Easy..fast...variety and I love it.
"Always great and a number of menus to choose from, try it I think you'll like it."
So far so good.. haven't get any issues with uber eats..great app
Food was not delivered.
Perfect
Was great at first because there were quite a few promotions available and it makes it so much easier to order food. For the past 6 months I have had zero promotions and everyone else that I know has had something like 100 free deliveries while I get told I'm ineligible for the promotion.
Reliable service! Great experiences with customer service team! No complaints.
"MISSING ITEMS AND DELIVERY COST If you're returning a product because it's faulty and doesn't meet your consumer guarantees, then the remedy provided by the retailer should not come at any extra cost to you. And if it does, the business will be required to reimburse you. It is not required to reimburse the initial postage charges."
"MY REVIEW WAS DELETED Terrible. Ordered food, have the order came and the driver didn't speak any English so couldn't understand. He grabbed the bag out of my hand and left. As soon as he left this app said the order was complete. The app has ""customer support"" which does nothing. Googled a phone number, waited online for 20mins went through all the details and he goes, well your order is complete so I cant help. Just robots, so unprofessional. Do not use!!!! Jokers"
So seamless and easy. Great job! Love the emphasis on LOCAL food establishments. Still use it in D.C. in 2020.
I cannot use my account
"It won't let me log in, recognises my email but no log in feature, can't re register either - pathetic!"
This has gone totally downhill !! Our food has been stolen by the uber driver and this is 2nd time in 1 week and when you call uber eats your waiting for 1hour and still cant get hold of anyone. Just eat or deliveroo is your much safer option !
Good goodies
"The ability to get restaurant food in the quiet and comfort if my home. No arguing diners, no screaming children ruining a romantic evening. What else do you need to know?"
"Here's a fair idea. If a restaurant takes more than 30 mins to deliver you should be shown a button that allows you to cancel. I think that's pretty fair. At the moment the app is in favour of the restaurants, they can take 3 hours and the app still tells you to wait or go through complicated options to report your mistreatment."
Very good.app
"Great app, but needs more deals and promos. It's kind of discouraging to use the app."
Fast
So far I haven't had any issues!!
"Good app. Very convenient, however I sometimes have problems using my debit card."
"A BIG disappoint, your driver Alejandro is a rude egotistical guy its disgusting how many time he raised his voice and out the phone down constantly, my order wasn't delivered or my money put back in my account ... this happened tight now . I want this sorted NOW and I want my money REFUNDED to me IMMEDIATELY... thank you but u can keep your app !!! I hope no one goes through what I just did .... he doesn't deserve to deal with people!!!!! GET WELL MANNERED DRIVERS PLEASE .."
"An absolute con! All restaurants have marked up their prices, and Uber charge an extortionate amount on fees on top of that, and delivery costs are far too high. They also have no grip on their drivers, as they're all apparently cycle to my address using cars, which means they aren't paying business insurance on the road."
Easy to order and great service from drivers .
Pretty good idea
"Very good, handy"
so convinient
☺❤
Do not install this your orders are always wrong and incorrect and to make it worse the customer service in this app sucks
Great delivery drivers
Is interesting that driver disappeared on the map hmmm
Useful and easy to use
Good food options and (sometimes) fast delivery
Where is my order??? I ordered food and we didn't receive it
"This app is very deceptive. At the end of the order they add a ""service fee"" on top of the regular taxes and tip. It makes an order that would usually cost $12 in the store become $25 on here. Save your money and use doordash they're cheaper and honest."
Quick delivery and great service
"I love the app ,i have know problem using the app, it's very helpful and I will definitely recommend it to friends & family."
"I love this app. And the system for the drivers is great. Never have had a messed up order. Also your driver doesn't have to handle any of the money, they can. But don't have to like doordash. The only thing I'd change is making an option for no ice in drinks, or messaging your driver before they pick your food up."
"With 4 to 5 different add on taxes, services and completely made up charges, its twice the price for cold food that's guaranteed to be sitting in someone's car who doesn't live in the area and cant find your house since his GPS took him kn the 407 in the wrong direction. Accuracy of order is about as good as going through the drive through and not checking the bags contents. UPDATE You did follow up, you literally said I complain too much. Would you like me to post your email to me? Go to..."
My delivery driver stole my food! He had just picked it up from the takeaway and started riding off in the wrong direction. I didn't get charged but Uber has no way of reporting a delivery driver. If you try to complain Uber will say it's fine because you were not charged. I've now being waiting 2x as long for my order and the takeaway have lost money from the wasted order. I cannot get why Uber let people get away with this. Also I couldn't reply to their support message as it's broke.
"As much as I like Uber taxi as much I hate Uber eats. Your delivery takes forever, I haven't had so many issues with other apps like rappi or delivery so far"
Perfect
"Crashes, inconsistencies, same pics for different restaurants"
"El PEOR servicio de delivery en El Salvador. No te entregan los pedidos completos y es casi imposible hablar con alguien para buscar una solución. Cuando al fin logra uno comunicarse no ofrecen soluciones, solo devolver el monto faltante en créditos del servicio que, además NUNCA devuelven. Son ladrones y estafadores. Ocupen cualquier otra app para delivery."
"User friendly , but I wish it could deliver at my home address"
Love it. X
Lately they are taking a long time to deliver the food...
A Little expensive but works well
No takeaways in locality. Despite this I see endless adverts and receive dozens of emails.
👍
Wow
(slight chuckaluck) yeah
I got charged for an order I didn't get
Great!!
Terrible customer service and if u dispute anything with them they then threaten to deactivate your account. Never using them again better of just using just eat they actually help you and only have to wait for McDonald's joing soon. So Uber eats will go down the pan. Always late food cold food missing food but yet that's the customers problem.
"Absolutely ridiculous of an app incorrect orders,missing orders"
Some of the most confusing fee structures I've ever seen. Like I choose $0 delivery fee and the time hasn't expired I go to the pay menu and I see $2 delivery fee and a service fee charge?!?
"Made an order Sept 19 in Canada which never turned up. I got a refund and life went on. 5 months later, they have charged me for it again. I emailed a complaint only for them to tell me they won't refund me because the order is too old and I should have emailed them earlier. I am absolutely livid."
Waste
For a well known company errors are deeply upsetting.
Very usefull
I've been having such a hard time verifying my account.
"Always giving me a discount thru my email, most recommended app for food delivery... Thank you UBER EATS"
Great .
Really awful application
App gets stuck after ordering. Doesn't allow to send the uber drive a message .very disappointed
great
At busy times can be a bit of a pain ..
They don't come here. And there's no way to look up without downloading. As we have 2 eateries in my town that's less than 15 minutes from fayetteville nc plus I 95 available it's a shame a company hasn't jumped on this area. We dont want just pizza or subs. Hurry up already you come out here for uber rides
"Can't change phone or password... I forgot my password and I can't log in because I changed my phone number.... And I still receive spam emails from Uber about promotions etc. You don't let me sign in, how can I use your app? If the person change phone number it's over??? What a bad app..."
Fast n professional Order on time.
Terrible. Always VERY late or doesn't arrive at all.
Refuses to let me login. Saying something went wrong over and over.
Good
Perfect service.
Good food and fast thanks Guys and girls at Ubereats keep up the good work
Terrible
I HAVE ALREADY TRIED MANY APPS BUT THIS APP IS SO GOOD..THERE ARE MANY PROMOTION ...NICE APP...I'M FULLY SATISFIED TO THIS APP
Sometimes the app is slow in either updating the order or time left on delivery otherwise no issues
Very good
Rychly a dobry
They always deliver in time
What do you do if you forgot which email address you used to register ?
Food always turns up cold and the delivery charge is extortionate not to mention being pestered to give a tip as well .
Excellent
This is the worst service I have ever used.....i will never use it again.....i can't order then wait for 2 hours to receive a message that says my order has been cancelled. It doesn't even deserve a star 💫
"A clunky app that swaps your discounts on you and makes you wait two hours for something you could have walked for in 45 minutes. Costly, shady, and low-quality."
Nice app
Great ui and tracking
Good app for delivering food
Fast...well done. Thank You
Pretty good...
"Waste of time. I live about a mile or so away from the takeaway I wanted to order from and the app keeps telling me I'm too far away. Update 28/02/2020: still doesn't work - says unavailable as I'm too far away. And I've no idea how to send a note in the link Uber gave me... What's wrong with good old fashioned email, Uber?"
Easy use quick response and customer service.
Very quick delivery and well made food. Absolutely recommend it
"Oki app, could do better"
Hair in my food but mcdonalds fault
None of your retail food shops are available today
Good
Good
Good
"The only form of customer service is an automated ""live chat"", no contact details are available to speak to an actual person, and the automated chat just repeats information without actually assisting. And it has just happened again. Really?"
Best customer services
"No way to login to existing account. I already have an account and there's no way to login to it, only to register a new one."
Gave this app another opportunity And they failed me once again No more after i receive my breakfast 1 1/2 later Bye bye uber eats your worthless Give me my delivery fee back 😡 After posting this review My order got canceled
Good app but alot of fees and such
Terrible
Good
It wouldn't let me use my gift card
"Try to log into the app, it says my email address is already registered. This is correct as I have already registered so why can't I continue my log in? They should be separate choices for existing and new users."
Everything is unavailable
but he nice
Almost every time I order off this app my food either doesnt show up or the drivers are rude and have another person in the vehicle. Terrible I dont recommend!!!
Ganking top lane
Ok
"Love this app, It makes ordering food easy."
I can't even use my gift card credits your app won't let me use it on Ubereats etc how can I fix this I have 107.00 left
Good with
Great
"Great service, but limited restaurant choices. I always end up ordering 
from the same 2 places."
I love it😍😍
"I'm DONE using this service! The drivers keep making other deliveries en route to my house so my food is always cold. And now I did not receive all the products I paid for. So now I'm going hungry for the night. Flip how hard is it to check what items to pick up?? And then I ask the driver ""what now?"". He just stands there clueless! So I am done. This is a totally unprofessional service."
"Bad experience with the App, so I've downloaded the app and I'm hungry and I'm ready to order but it can't find my location, please do something coz I'm not staying at the mountain I live in Soweto."
Great app. The order notes for items in certain menus dont always show up when they should it's great for when restaurants aren't consistent with certain items or when something isnt listed when it should be. I've had quite the experience with forgotten items recently it would be nice if order notes would stay consistent for all items regardless of actual necessity cause sometimes I just dont order because the same order has been messed up so many times
"It's awesome, really, it is!"
Good
Use of use
"If it's acquired by Zomato already, and the Zomato app is already on the app Store, why the hell the Uber eats app on the store still . Why don't you remove it."
Nada a reclamar.
Not a lot of options near me
"Most times, it is great! Twice we've been charged for food that wasn't received & when we disputed the transactions, account was locked. No issues since then. Great convenience!"
Works great
It's an ok app
"Uber eats is a great app.However, I hate the fact that they charge you R10 delivery fee even if the store is within 400meters,that's daylight robbery!!"
Terrible dont use!!
Bad experience because I got a msg that get 99% offer for minimum order of 50Aed on first purchase but fake promotion I tried promotion it showing not eligible..why you guys spreading fake offers
Pathetic Service and Cheating customers fake promotions... Don't use
Nice when u have a big family and don't want get everyone dress
Love it.. Best of its kind
Best food app ever
Unable to login .OTP not recieved on my number despite several tries
Good service
Delivery is quick
I have had 2 terrible experiences ordering via Uber eats. The company is not efficient at troubleshooting problems experienced with vendors.
"What's the point of asking customers rate and write reviews on restaurants if WE as customers can't see each other's reviews? If a restaurant sells bad wings, we deserve to know so that we don't waste our money on them! Why hide reviews? Are url on the customer's side or what? Annoyed! Also, outline restaurants' operational times. And make it compulsory that restaurants upload images of the food on the menu! Most of us are reluctant to try food we can't see on the menu."
App shows me to buy from zomato !!!!
Bad
Excellent App
Just works!
"App has makes it very hard to complain about service. My order was missing all the food, only had drinks. Get help link was hard to find, had to google how to do it And when i finally log my complaint, no confirmation was received. Also, I couldn't check the status of my complaint in the app. Avoid uber eats is my advice. Service terrible, app very poor."
Support team is absolutely useless
"I am trying to add my phone number but it keeps telling me over and over again that something went wrong and to try again, despite how many times I try it never seems to work"
Love them
اسوء تجربة في برنامج طلب اكل مر عليا في حياتي و الله ، خدمة العملا سيئة جدا و البرنامج مبيديش اي معلومات مفيدة سواء ايجاب او سلب او error حتي يفهمني ان فيه مشكلة ، مش ممكن كم السوء و الله
I ordered 3 times and each time my food took more than an hour and cold not correct they still charged me I'm not ever using this app again 😡
"Only used it twice so far, but really good."
Great up
"Hi sir, I am really missing uber eats in India I do not go with zomato,swiggy, etc only uber eats"
Yes love it. Its easy to use
This app is awful & so is uber eats as you don't deliver to my area but subway do so you've lost a customer due to your inability to provide a service to paying customers!
"Still can't register, kept saying ""your account does not have a password."" Already tried to uninstall and install several times."
"Love the convenience and variety of food, great service"
I don't know how it happened that my account was disabled.
I cannot delete cards previously used and when a driver calls it doesn't ring on my phone
I am loving the versatility of this app. Something I've needed for a longxtime.
I am very disappointed with the app and service. I places an order for delivery after 5.30pm as soon as the order placed I received a message saying it was on it way. I called straight away to get the time amended as it had gone through incorrectly to be told that the restaurant had already prepared (this was within 1 min of placing order) and that I would be charged either way and to basically get someone to my house to collect. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!
Poor
UBERRRRRRRRRR😁
It always says there is a problem with the card I use. Funny because they have no problem with Uber rides. Also if I put an item from the restaurant in my cart and then change my mind there is no place to delete it. I have tried all the obvious ways but it doesn't work for me. I can even go back in the app later and it's still in there. So my son has to order from his app and yes he did try to delete it from my app to no avail. Reply. . I havr done what you said to do and still no resolve
Nice
Horrible!!! never received my food and can't cancel my order its STEALING
Nice app
Still no option to sign in when app is reinstalled. Get a message saying your email is already registered. Thats it. No option to use the same email again. Seriously stupid app as I said a year ago and still no fix to this basic issue that many other users also complain about online. Fine - Uber will not have my money. Stagnation will eventually lead to its downfall.
Why can't you order a cup of coffee at wawa.
Please come back in india
"Uber eats is getting very incompetent, earlier this week it took more than an hour for me to get my order and today I place an order and they are only telling me after 1 hour and 30 minutes that they couldn't deliver my order, apparently they couldn't find a driver. I honestly don't understand."
Good
"Easy to use, hope to add more restaurants and the dish pictures in menu (visual aid really helps a lot)"
Exceptional 👌🏽
Good app
"The app is highly reliable and far better compared to Mr. D delivery. Even when there is an issue, their service team is quick and effiecent to assist and attend to any problems foreseen. I love this app"
Good
App keeps saying places available then as soon as you go to basket they become unavailable this has happened numerous times now and have given up
Your Free Delivery promo doesn't work. It crashes and can't add to cart.
If Zomato takes over the Uber eats then why you have wasted 37 mb of customer
Thank you so much
I ordered food and paid driver cash and now it says l am owing UberEats and mind you this driver took 2 hours to show up at my place but on the app it showed l was suppose to meet him downstairs we waited downstairs for more than a hour paid him cash and now my uber eats is on credit
Very good
"Group orders doesn't work properly, I can only see half of the order until I place it after which you cannot edit anything...!!! This needs to be fixed..."
Canceled my orders many times All orders canceled after waiting more than hour And the support was bad
Can't enter correct delivery address
Great service
Worst experience I won't recommend this app the worst app
👍
"Always takes takes so long that I cancel and use another app. Tried again. Still placed an order and takes so long I don't want it anymore. Zero customer support. Just stop offering this service. I paid for an order that I never got this time. Tried it again. The estimated time of arrival for my McDonalds is in one minute...still says ""preparing order."""
Live map doesn't update. Ordered a meal for one with 15-20 minute windows and takes over an hour? Don't know how ordering food at panda Express can take more than 5 minutes to apply. Thoroughly disappointed as a new user. Switching apps.
Discounts are good
They charged me 17 dollars for a cancellation because they couldn't find a driver . Will never use Uber anything ever again.
Struggled to verify so I my app was locked
Ive been trying to do an order but nothing is available
Great!
I ddnt get my food
Rubbish
"very unreliable, not suggested to use, they are not do what their said and what their promised, they are set up your money, and stolen your money by charge a small amount each time on your order, or give you a meal which is different your order(cheap)."
excellent service
I love it
Took too long for my food ended up cancelling the order
Everything was fine with me
Bad service
My food was cold but I was hungry
Great app
Great app
exelent
"Ok I fell in love with Uber Eats because they were professional, relatively inexpensive and FAST. Now after my 4th order in the rain theyre sending someone on a freaking bike! & no not a motorbike. This is ridiculous. The customer should have tbe say BOO Uber Eats"
Fabulous at making me lazy and fat. It would get the fifth star if there was an option to block me from my own food vices (at least in 30 day intervals.)
Wow i never knew how fun it could be to order dinner!
"Great food, good price"
Easy to use and fast service
Love Uber Eats!
I cannot create my account because this stupid app 😡😡😡 didn't send otp on my mobile number
Very delayed the food..
"+15 minutes to our delivery time as while our delivery was ""on its way"" it was in fact heading away from us while the driver made another delivery first. Yeah good. Love some cold food. Why does Uber eats allow this to happen? Edit: same thing happened again today. The food isn't the problem, it's not that it's unacceptable. It's the app allowing people on bicycles to make 2 deliveries that are km apart that is unacceptable. Stop passing the buck to the restaurants. Fix your app."
Food regularly cancelled
"Hood, nice design, simple, intuitive"
Un- insured moped drivers.
"NEVER EVER use ubereats ever again. Wish I could give NO STARS. This service is absolutely awful and such a disappointment TWICE in a row now. This is the second time I have placed an order, the order has been delayed over an hour passed the latest quoted delivery time, and while I'm still tracking the order it has been cancelled by the app. I have waited so long for food that I no longer have any other options open to order from. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS LACK OF SERVICE!"
Ordered some food eta was 10 mins but now have been waiting for more than an hour because of a rider delay and food still not arrived. Rip. I'll have to pay for cold food if and when it gets here in the next year.
"I waste time ordering from a restaurant, only to be told at checkout that it's too far away."
Horrible. The estimated time went waaaaay past expected. Refund promised never processed. Use door dash
Excellent!
"The app is average. Works when it needs to. But the customer service absolutely sucks and has prevented me from using Uber eats. Customer service is so important and the way you treat paying customers is shocking. No thanks, I would rather use your competitors."
Excellent 👍
Quick and eazy fare price
great
Excellent
They don't do refunds people which I am sure is illegal...
Great service love the free delivery
Won't take my card no now not AI the time tho but when hungry not good
Cannot order off this app. It keeps logging me in and goes straight to delivery status saying my order is on its way. I haven't even looked at a menu yet. Won't let me go back or exit.
Good service.
I cant open my app. It wants password
"After a long day at work , you just want food served on a plate and this app does it the best."
"Easy and very easy to use😂🥰🥰🥰, And the Services are awesome, l edge you to try it Out"
I placed a order an hour ago and it still cant find a driver to deliver it to me. This was ordered in the share a courier selection. If i cancell i will still get charged. Not very happy.
Pre good
Great for convenience but pricey
Getting worse every month... Fire yourselves
Food was delayed 3 times when i tried to cancel she acted like she didnt want to do the s*** dont download this junk ass app.. If i could give a 0 for the stars i would.. Bad bad bad service no way im using this s*** anymore.
Great experience so far. 😁
Amazing
Sucks sometimes! But they alway fix my issues.
I love uber eats
Quick service
Great app. Never had any problems.
Nice
I get fed
All was been good
"Customer service is very poor, they even don't know how to respect customer. The only app that doesn't have time frame for delivery and never delivers on time."
Great App. Works like Grab or Lineman
Love your service
They come through when you need them. Shout out to the driver's working hard. Respect and appreciation 💯!!
"Ordered a meal and it was missing a drink and ordered another meal which 
got refused by the restruant and its going to take 2 weeks to get a refund, 
the APP could charge you after it has been accepted but no, Uber isn't that 
smart. This APP is just like an ATM when taking out cash, if the ATM 
doesn't have the $300 in cash it will still charge your account and take 2 
weeks to resolve."
Uber needs to screen their food delivery people as hard as they screen their drivers. The delivery chick literally act like she delivered my food and stole it! I made a complaint and received a refund but they need to stop giving gutter thief rats jobs and give the positions to honest people. I wasnt feeling well at all..thats the only reason i used this app despite past bad experiences i had but this one takes the cake! Food apps giving restaurants bad reputations! App deleted! 0 stars
Great
"The delivery was smooth, quick and efficient... Great app"
The delivery never arrived after telling the driver she was at the wrong complex. Now I can't reach customer no service.
Friggin' awesome! The best thing since sliced bread. Quite literally.
I don't like how if you cancel something it takes your money anyways. And what happens if a uber isn't picking up your order cause that's happening to me right now.
"App didn't allow me to place a simple order from a restaurant close to my house (McDonald's) with no reason given. In the past, I've gotten orders made incorrectly, from various restaurants, and when I tell them when I rate my order, nothing happens. Garbage customer service. Won't order from them again."
Waited an whole hour and half to cancel my food at the last minute. So now I have to go to bed hungry because all this time I waited I could have ate some where else. Am beyond upset thanks alot..
Best food delivery
"Was great but as of recent if I want to get food past a certain time, the app is not available please come back later. Pretty annoying."
Good food delivery app
"Very easy to use and to manage my preferences, previous orders, and promotions."
I love how convienent everything is.
"this app was okay save for the glitchy tracking feature. it will show the driver in the same spot until they get to my home. now, it has gotten worse because in 2 months, i have received 5 different orders with items made incorrectly, and only twice have i received satisfactory help with those orders."
Delivery never came. Waited over an hour! First and last time using app. Got charge because there wasn't a driver. I will dispute and get full refund. Trash @ubereats!
Let's me be lazy. Gets depression fighting food to me fast. 10/10
Telling me that it's not associated with my email if my email that I put is with my phone number I would give this a 0 star
"Well I gave this a try. It charged me a myriad of fees and right now I'm looking into a 30 min delay with the driver riding with my food way out in the country doing God knows what. And I can't seem to be able to cancel the order altogether. That's awesome. Never again I'll use this piece of s*** app, and I don't recommend it to anyone."
The service is terrible so the food is always old and gross. They bait and switch you by promising 20-30 min delivery times that always end up being an hour . Lousy. Every time without fail. They exploit us fat lazy Americans.
"I had high hopes for this app. The app functions pretty well but honestly I think theres just too many moving parts for it to work every time. About 80% of our orders have incorrect or missing items which isnt a huge deal because they can refund you for whatever was messed up or missing, it just sucks when you wait an hour and your order is cancelled so you just end up going out and getting the food yourself instead. XD"
I love this app.
Was awesome very fast and friendly!! Driver went above and beyond.
Way better than doordash
"Excellent app, works great. Easy to use."
"I had to verify my order, for ""trust"" even when i have been using the regular uber for years... Then i click on verify with facebook, which opens a mobile version (not the app) and doesn't do anything. God bye."
Food is always fresh and hot and delivery drivers are very nice
"Works very well and is very user friendly. We'll see what the delivery quality is like in my area, hit or miss no matter what service you use. Update: VERY spotty service, and apathetic customer support. Go get your food yourself if at all possible."
Works wonders
"I used this app frequently, however recently I haven't even been able to pay for items. Every single payment method I use, i am told that I need to use a different payment method, even when my card has money in it. Shame. Was a good food delivery system until this. No way of getting help either."
Great
Tired of being asked to rate
Love It!
Will steal your money
Thieves. Their driver stole my food and the customer service stole my money
Kool great
Terrible service
They will cancel your order and keep your money
"Deliver driver said food was delivered but drove off with our food that we waited an hour for. Help number was useless, with the representative refusing to issue us a credit in addition to our refund to compensate us for their terrible service."
lil addictive... ethical thing to do would be placing something like a lives system where you limit the amount of days one account can order in a day and in a week
Bad
"Customer support will try to offer you $5 uber monopoly money even if they screw up delivering a $50 order. They will take advantage of you. Use any other app. Edit: As you can see from their response, they can't even copy and paste correctly. There's no way you're also going to get food on time hahahaha wow."
Nice app and what a close app
Awful
The best service ever!
"The subway option on my app isn't working correctly, and I can't order from subway now because it already has options picked, and I can't customize my sandwich like I want."
Good app but pricey
Good nuff
Terrible customer service If they mess up an order it is very hard to fix it
Keep saying error loading
superb
"What a pile of s... company! I was standing outside for 30 minutes waiting on a moron, this property is a huge oval, someone with 2 brain cells couldn't get lost in here! Then he somehow marks the order as delivered, and the company with the call center in India, oh we will just refund your money, you will get it in 3 to 5 business days. This is a small property! I've had a Postmate driver deliver to the side of the interstate 15 without an address, at a state line!!! This describes the competency level of the Uber Eats drivers!!! Matthew, Toyota Prius, 70D646... drop him and raise the collective IQ of the Uber Eats driver pool infinity!"
I changed my phone number and couldn't log back into my account
"It was worst ever experience with this app, tje currior took the food and ran away."
driver was unable to use the provided credit card to buy the food after I called support on their behalf they ended up canceling the order while I may be refunded by original money I'm still hungry.
RE: REPLY-> no you haven't. Don't lie. That just makes it even worse. HORRIBLE! NOBODY TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR AN ORDER THAT IS AN HOUR LATE AND STILL HASNT ARRIVED. NO ONE TO CALL NO DRIVER TO TALK TO COZ IT WONT CONNECT UNTIL FOOD IS PICKED UP. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SPEAK WITH JUST A STUPID RECORDING SAYING THEY CANT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST GO BACK TO THE APP! AFTER EVERYTHING AND THE FRUSTRATION OF WAITING AND TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF ANYONE THEY LITERALLY JUST CANCELLED!!
this app is just getting worst and worst like i said they reponded to my review beforr my orders 🤣😂 the customer service is still horrible you cant contact anyone on the team to helo you see whata going on i waited like 1.5h for a driver that was standing at the same spot probably the guy was home felt asleep at that point you just gotta wait because you cant contact the driver or the uber team to see whats going i tell uou their customer service is just worst and worst. joke of an app.
Ok
Started our great but lately it's a waiting game. The last several times I have waited so long that by the time my food gets here it's cold because there are no drivers available. It would be nice to know when a driver will be available or how busy it is. Definitely gonna start looking at other delivery options.
Crashes every single time with the message Server Error!
"Worst delivery service! The driver delivered the wrong order and before i could tell him that it was wrong, he quickly got in his car and drove away, taking my food with him. Multiple reviews state the same thing happend to them. Drivers often steal customer's food. I will never use this app again. Lesson learned!!"
I got a new number but it won't let me use it cause someone else made an account with it. So i can't use my email
"I love being a little lazy after working all day and having a treat to end it. Uber Eats has changed the game of how we live, love, and of course EAT!"
"Can,t login. Please fix my problem"
"After they took $250 from me, they stopped answering my emails and calls. After 6 months of nonstop reaching out, it was never resolved. There is something shady happening with this company"
Yay
"Suporte pra ser ruim, tem que melhorar.. Estou tentando há 24h pedir reembolso de pedido não entregue.. no concorrente vermelho eu já teria conseguido.. Suporte por telefone não resolveu e sugeriu que eu ligasse pra outro atendente (parece brincadeira), suporte in-app também ainda não me respondeu. Enquanto eu puder, eu vou dizer pra todo mundo que conheço pra não confiar na plataforma, pois o suporte operacional não aparenta ter maturidade suficiente pra resolver um simples problema!"
"My order was 31 mins late the offered me 25% off on my next order that I had to use in 14 days. My food was cold as well, I informed uber and requested a refund for my $32 order. They gave me $5 uber credit. Without even responding to my complaint apologizing which is standard for unhappy clients."
Love it
I love the free delivery option.
Easy to use
No longer functions on my Android. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it 3 times in the last 2 months. It is supposedly up to date. I've cleaned up and rebooted my cell each time. It still freezes. I have to use the website on my laptop instead which is inconvenient since it's rarely on nowadays.
Poor got my order wrong
"This is my first experience with uber eats and I am highly upset. My driver made it to the restaurant but after that, he dissapeared off the tracker. My delivery was pushed back another 20 minutes. That's ok with me. It has been 10+ minutes and uber eats has still not found a driver. Found driver. Arrived at store. Order cancelled 1 hour after the first arrival time. Only way I got a refund was because I did not get the food after 1+ hour wait after arrival time..Never again will I try uber eat"
Quick and fast
Wont let me use my uber credits so whats even the point? I wasted like 50 bucks on uber credits that i cant even use
"Awsome , fast ❤"
Nice
Very kind and friendly
Cool app
"Great app, especially when you don't have a vehicle to get around in."
Prefer Uber eats over the others. They have more options better delivery fees/promotions.
Will refund for messed up orders. Good system.
Easy to use
"Worst delivery service, drivers eat from the food, take longer routes to restaurant and frequently forget stuff."
its high quality software
This app doesn't even let me log in to a an account I already have an account but it doesn't say log in I'm rating this who one star I wish I could rated 0 stars but it won't allow me so I am raining it so stars because it won't allow me
"Nicely done... Restaurant may need to give options to change the menu, even if it's a charge extra."
Good
Love it
The experience with this app is extreme
perfect no issues at all
Very efficient app
Food always fresh and hot. Had one bad incident but the good out weigh the bad and besides they accomedated me. Great job Uber Eats
Generously given ordered food no driver available received a $5 discount how thoughtful. I'm in England....
Gift card don't work and when ordering food it doesn't work
Thank You
Muy bien el servicio
Good app
I have changed my phone number. So this app doesn't give me login page by email. Just wow... I am using some other app to order delivery. Thanks Udumb
Works well. Not a fan of the fees. Good promos sometimes.
Verry good job
Fees are ridiculous
Fast and clean
Food arrived 2 hours late and cold.
Good
Its been ok ww cab sprk om timing
I ordered Uber Eats with my friends during school. In total we spent over 100 dollars on our order. We waited over 1 hour to receive our food. When the driver called he had an attitude and also yelled at me over the phone. We then called him multiple times because we had been waiting for so long for our food. He didn't answer the phone and I ended up having to call customer service and receive a refund and I stayed hungry. I highly recommend that you don't use Uber Eats to order food.
The drivers are always polite and in time
Great used twice now an great service! Would definitely recommend to anyone
"Order got cancelled for no reason, before delivery time. Contacted takeaway who said they did not recieve it. Very dissapointed"
so you place a order an wait a hour after you already pay for your order too be canceled y'all suck
Pretty good
Worst customer service possible.
My order was picked up after 55 minutes it was ready. It came not so fresh at all. After rising it uber eats I got automated email that they don't care about my order but will try to improve. So much below standard set up by completion. It's my last order by this app. Odder providers are a lot better with customer service.
"This app is so user friendly, i like that i don't have to phone the restaurant to place an order. There is a variety of places to order food from, and deliveries are always fast and drivers are friendly, courteous and polite. Keep it up!"
5 star.
This app Stinks the restaurant options are very limited and the app itself freezers up and stops working constantly!! I might have to try a competitor app because it might just work better.....
"Delivery on time, food great! 👍🏼"
جاني عرض كود على بطاقة الراجحي ولما طلبت قال مافي .. ليه الكذب على الناس .. تطبيق قمة في السوء
Incredible service
Atrocious! Uneducated insolent person refused to deliver my order. The help center sends me on a wild goose chase as he says my order was delivered. Absolutely unprofessional. I have not been refunded. I would never recommend this service. Do yourself a favour and never use credit cards as no one bothered to help as long as you've paid.
"I keep receiving a message that I don't have a registered number everytime I try to place an order. Per an email from customer service I need to use the app to update any information. However, I can't get past the section requesting my number. I'm done with Uber Eats."
Multiple orders delayed and when called spport there was nothing the person could do. Uninstalling app and using Doordash as this has been way better.
So convenient!
Everytime i order i put in the note to driver check order they never do and im always missing items ordered today missing 70% of order and its cold i phone mcdonalds parons hill they say its down to uber to contact them so i contact uber who conveniently dont reply i feel ripped off not good business sense is it....... UPDATE im still waiting nearly a week later for a part refund not happy
"Had a problem with my order food was disgusting, soaked in grease leaking out the box and they had the nerve to give me a full refund then take it back and give me 5$..."
Please test your app properly before any release! Hire testers and don't be conjuice! I got struck on a screen with the new update and cannot do anything. It just prompts us to enter delivery address. It doesn't auto populate any address or does nothing after entering address and tap search. When i tap back button i just kicked out of app. Uber !🙏🙏
This app is honestly good but it should try a adding a login option because what if I get a new phone and now I am unable to login into my uber eats account then that means I have to create a new account Please kindly address this issue
Fantastic
Too buggy...I lose 2 hours every time to make an order
"Worst experience ever! Ordered at 7 only to find out at 9pm that my food wont arrive till late! Then to be told by the agent that if I cancel I'll be charged. I theb found out that uber cancelled with the restaurant, even though the app says its stiill being prepared at 9:08 pm."
Love it
The app is full headech of to register
Love quick efficiant and easy to use
This app keeps getting worse and worse
Great
Drivers dont give back your change and are very rude
I just installed it and just been stocked on address signing page and didnt even go to menu options or home tabs button in short I cannot place an order. It just keep on going to address page and then NOTIFY ME button. Uninstalled it and installed but still the same.
Really poor customer service when things hi wrong
Use doordash or GrubHub. Uber designs their products to prevent you from effectively complaining about their shortcomings. This prevents then from effectively improving any of their crummy apps to meet your needs.
I love it
Awful customer service dont use uber eats
Very good food always comes quickly delivery drivers are polite and friendly overall a good company and app the only thing that does bother me is the delivery charge its expensive
App keeps giving issues no matter how many times i update it and try to refresh it.
It doesn't want to work
"Apart from the several hiccups, such as getting orders wrong and delivery guys showing up after the latest estimated time, this is a really useful app... Just make sure your not too hungry when you order, because you will wait for the longest."
Worst app ever I would recommend using other apps Uber eats are not responsible
Always sends the wrong order I'm so mad!!!
"Horrible customer service, they don't care about your orders at all. Only seems they want your money and don't care about anything else. Use am skip the dishes."
Its Quick and easy
Great
"Delivery is usually quick and efficient. Unfortunately, app only works half the time."
Have had some issues and delays but it's okay in general. Also dont have ALL the restaurants.
Awesome
Its almost 10 days my amount not refunded. .i dont need your damn application.. i am ordered food 10.50 pm waiting long time up to 12.30 am my order canceled automatically and my money not refunded my time waste.main thing is My hunger also drank.. Order food one day before then only we will get in time ..#uber eats our time ..amount not credited
eats-asrd91 for 10 pound of new users
Trash delivery service!
Good
Somewhat satisfactory
They robe me 20 bucks
"I LOVE it! There are so many delicious ,fast and convenient options to choose from. I am so glad I downloaded this app this week."
The only criticism is that you can't select duplicates of an item when selecting sides from KFC for instance. With Mr delivery you can select 3 of the same side whereas on uber eats you can only select 1 of each different side options.
Am unable to order food
Great and very fast
Good
Love the discount vouchers...
Great service
Good job
Geat app
Never del kfc
This app has been crashed
The first time was not good I said not gonna happen again but I tried it again and so far it's been good
Love this app foods always quick and always arrives hot and fresh
"Used to be certain that the food I ordered would be hot, fresh and delivered quickly.... though most of the time it is still ok on delivery, more often now food is bare.y warm or cold, and I am paying quite alot for it once I add on delivery fee"
Worst customer service I never experience be very careful
Terrible service. Slow cold food no customer service It says preparing your order. But when you call the restaurant and they tell you that your order has been ready for quite some time who's fault is it
"Really poor, my delivery was combined with deliveries in another suburb. Food arrived cold and soggy. How do I opt out of combined deliveries? I'd rather order elsewhere in that case. Really bad experience."
Great
"Did not receive the order, in application was status delivered. Support response only with a template message. I do not recommend anyone to use."
"It's ok, but the specials are confusing, constantly changing or expiring without notice."
All good always on time
Cant log in
Amazing service and delicious food yaaaammmmyyyy mmmmhhhh 😋😋😋😋
خدمة سئ جدا يعني ازاي لو طلبت order بالغلط وبعدها الغي في نفس الوقت بعدها اقعد 10 دقائق علشان حد يرد عليا يقولي ال order بتاعك اتحضر ومس هينفع يتلغي ما بسبب تاخير بتاعكم في رد .. مهزلة في التعامل
Good service
it is not found in shoubra
"I already had an account but after sometime i deleted it. Now i again restarted it, i forget it's password. K cant restart it again. Give a solution."
Started strong in December now I work 12 hours and get maybe 8 orders with a 98% rating and never cancellation on anyone's orders. To many people deliver in this app and it sucks to work 13 hours some days and get less than 75$ cash. I've been working 20 to 30 hours a week on this app and making less than 250 to less than 370 cash before taxes. You cannot work Uber full-time in Seattle area. To may already do and there's just not enough orders to go around. No real driver support. 0 star worst
"Restaurant missed items off order, sent food back, requested refund only to be told NO refund by uber EATS. NEVER GET THE ORDERS RIGHT"
Uber is HORRIBLE!! Everyone I recommend Favor. It took Uber one hour and thirty seven minutes to deliver my food. This was the second time it happened. I should have learned my lesson the first time. Also with Favor your first delivery is free and no delivery fee for 30 days. I wish I could get my money back. So upsetting. I hardly use Uber but i was running behind schedule and had a meeting to attend so I knew I wouldn't have time to stop. Angry ex customer!!
App sends bikes to do pick ups in freezing weather resulting in cold food... sometimes your food is walked to your house in freezing cold weather!
Works well
It works wonderful and I love using it. It's very convenient when you are in a rush.
Cannot delete old cards...
"Some delivery prices are just unreasonable. I don't usually give myself a chance to fully relax- when I do, if the delivery's fee costs almost the same as the meal.. this app will not be seeing a fourth star. Five stars are unattainable."
Soo fast therefore my food was beautifully hot. Could not be happier to switch from skip the dishes to you guys🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏼
"Id go 0 stars, it wont even let me sign in/up, I type in my phone number then tell me to type in password, it says password is wrong, so I tried typing in my email nd it says its not associated with my phone number...."
Always fun to sit at home and wait for great taste food and you'll never have to leave home or wast gas if you want something far away from you uber eats will get it to you fast and hot
We need Uber eats in our area Unit12 Westham Drive Phoenix Keep getting vouchers but cannot use it because Uber eats is not yet in our area😢
Good app. Promotions made it better.
It's a very bad experience to order food from Uber food was no freshed over cooked and cold and even I complain but don't have any response I Lost my money and time both it's very bad experience I will not order next time ever
The best
Very very good
"Great idea, way to expensive. Theres practically a fee just to open the app. Also most options don't have the full menu available. There are times where the food is cold, messed up and your stuck with it. I'll go get my food myself thanks."
How the heck am I suppose to get a password if the app just asks for my number and then it's says your account has no password?
Good
Bad app never use🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅👎
Oh very excellent.. Not disappointed 👌💓
reall good
Best
I tried ordering but it kept on saying I have an outstanding fee of R2 which I don't understand how
You were best but sold to Zomato
As entregas de bicicleta deveriam ser feitas em um raio de poucos km assim não correria o risco da comida chegar fria como vêm acontecendo nos meus últimos pedidos.
"Atualmente, pior aplicativo de entregas."
Awesome apps
"All kinds of extra fees that never existed. Good communication and service but the ""service fee"" plus all other markups drive your bill almost double its size"
Promotion first time not working
If you want us to book from Zomato then y hell keep this app... Just don't waste our time and data
I have been using uber eats for a while now never had ane issue up until now I opted out of number thing so iv been now trying to gt bk into but everytime I send th message it js says failed its been ok in th past its js up until recently so I was wondering if u cud help me resolve this issue thnx
"Disgraceful is an understatement. A glitch in the app didn't allow me to complete my order, and so I made other plans but then got a notification over an hour later that my food had arrived. I told the vendor to notify Uber that there was an issue. Why would I pay for something that isn't my fault? I immediately get bombarded by 'customer service' whose only concern was that I pay up immediately. Not one question about the experience or issue. Was it a prank? Shocking really."
It's kept saying something went wrong. Even tho I've do e nothing but trying to create an account or whatever the step is
What time do you open up the app? Also can you pay with cash?
"Simple easy to use, bringing a wide variety of cuisines to your door step."
This app doesn't exist / work anymore (India)
"Terrible, waited for 3 hours for food that never came i was still charged for it and customer service never got back to me"
"Apsalutely awful, they wont let me verify my account so I cant order, what a waste of time"
It's my first time using it and I didn't get my order
👍🏽
"Every time I open the app, there is always something that does not work."
Bad customer service overall with a standard copy paste responds. They have forgotten to think of the options where if most of your food has not been delivered it is not your responsibility to pay the delivery fee a second time if you do not want to stay hungry. Simple response from them was there's nothing we can do :)
"3 orders canceled in one month after one hour waits, no notification after the order gets canceled, you have to constantly keep checking the app to see if anything happens, and after one hour and your food got canceled? They just they you to order again at full price, a huge middle finger to the customer."
"They tell step by step like when they got your order, when order is picked up and on it's way."
Driver stuck without petrol tells me i must give him 5 mins im still waiting 20mins later you can keep your cold food.
Very satisfying ❤
"Excellent 👍. Add more digital wallet payment options. In Kenya, we have MPESA and Airtel money."
Good
"I received half my order, I had to ring Zamberos to find out what happened to the brownies I ordered with my burritos. I paid for delivery, I should not have gone down to the store to collect them. It was their error.I will only rate you 2 because of this. The delivery guy was great but Zamberos you need to make sure the order is checked before going out the store. The order should have what you ordered. I should have asked for petrol money being I had to use my car."
Worst app seen in my life
I did not receive my order
I can't log in and it keeps telling to sign in and I've never open or created an account before it's really bad.
"Ok, Uber Eats is likely a flawlessly working app as Uber has always been, but not with my device now! Sorry to say my story ended up at choosing my address with no results but a fetching error."
Great app
Awful it does not work ! It doesn't complete the payment!
Love it 😍
😋😋😋
Worst experience from a food delivery service. I have been charged several times as a Pending charge even though I haven't used the app on or before the charged dates. Contacted the bank and they confirmed the charged has been made to Uber. Called hotline several times and while waiting for agent the call got disconnected 3 times. Finally contacted an agent and she says they don't know about anything of the mentioned charge. Very unprofessional service from the Agent. No support whatsoever.
"Broken. Keeps asking for a new address and gives a search for location error. I cant leave the screen. Tried updating, restarting, force stopping the app, nothing."
"Absolutely terrible. Tonight I ordered food that was never delivered, but I was charged for it. The person that responded to my complaint said the driver said he called my phone when I received no missed calls, suggested I leave more specific delivery instructions when my instructions could literally not have been more detailed and specific. I am so angry I am going to take this matter to the consumer ombudsman"
so good
"Uso l'app principalmente per il McDonald's e non ho mai avuto un problema, consegna gratuita e puntuale 👌🏻 consigliata! eats-ln384l <-- codice sconto 15€ per il primo ordine! 😏"
Exceptional
Waited over an hour for my food. Never got it. Going to bed without dinner. This app is trash.
"Last night I ordered from mcdonalds and I only got half of my order, I tried to write you and McDonald's, but no one wrote me back!!!!"
Very bad customer service
Superb
I just oeder so.e food from dennys and my food is ice cold and i am pissed off and i want my money back
Haven't had any problems so far
Litty🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Super
My experience is very bad
Amazing
Tell you to phone for faster response but when phoned tell you to do it on the app £20 of food sent to someone else great have to sit for 24h for a response
Thus far I've had a pleasant experience with the app but i don't know if the notes at the restaurants are too small or at a bad place to be seen because my notes barely get followed ... Otherwise I'm enjoying the app quite a lot... Really makes everything easier
Great app
Very good.
Convenient and easy to use. Have always rectified any mistakes quickly and fairly.
never got the food made me suffer for 2 hours with no food then I went for a walk to get my food from tesco and I tell you what.. EVERY LITTLE HELPS THANKS TESCO FOR BEING OPEN THAT DAY!
Whoever using this app get mad. Defenetly this is not user friendly.totaly wast and fool app.
Frais de livraison beaucoup trop élevés. J'ai desinstallé l'application après plusieurs mois de non-utilisation
BRILLIANT!!
I want Arabic language in app
App doesn't work when it supposedly sends me a text to verify my phone.
Why do restaurants say unavailable? Not closed. Just unavailable .. but Google says open..
Easy to use
"Dear Uber Eats team, I loved the service you provided earlier. But nowadays whenever i open the app you suggest me to use ZOMATO. In that case, why are you giving updates to this app??"
Too many deceptive practices and hidden fees.
"Detect wrong address and react as if It's customer’s fault. Doesn't deliver the order, makes inappropriate comment. Total harassing. Unprofessional delivery person. Shows attitude, super duper attitude. Disgusting."
Easy and reliable
Worst app log in problem
Lovely
سي جدا
Fast and realible
Good user friendly App
app is no more available asks to switch to zomato why simply waste users data. at least you can remove it.losers
"Please deliver to Katikati, Bay of Plenty. The app keeps saying uber eats will be ""coming soon"" to my town but that was a year ago. There are a few cafe's/restaurants in Katikati that would be very successful with Uber eats."
I love the app it's easy to use and me and my family really like it
Delivered on time friendly driver
worst app
"Why can't i enter my phone number at the initial setup.... Says ""something went wrong""..."
ممتاز ويتميز بالكثير من العروض للتوصيل المجاني والخصومات
A very good app
Good food to the door
Exceptional service
Best
Superb
App is fine. Orders are so expensive I usually just end up going to get the food myself.
Extremely useful when you've forgotten to eat or you want a quick snack. Up-pricing on some items is a bit extreme even with keeping in mind that uber has to make a profit.
nil
Good
Even after the payment was done the delivery person hasn't updated my payment. And I had to pay the payment again to obtain the Uber service. I think it would be better If walk to food store and get my needfull. And unhelpful customer service tooo.
Con artists
I was charged for buy 1 get 1 and I cancelled the order as soon as I got the riders number still I was charged and it's there in my account
Order was fast came 30 minutes earlier than expected time ❣🤞🏼🔥
Great
It dose not work
"Generally great, what bothers me is the incoherence on ordering at restaurants in the same area. For instance there is a Zambrero and Maccas at the same shop area(literally they're across the street from each other) but I can never order from Maccas even though the delivery location is the same. Please UberEats work on that so not only me but others can access more restaurant options."
My favourite restaurant is OUT OF RANGE and has never come back into my range for weeks. I havent moved and its only the next suburb. contacted the restaurant and they are getting orders. Contacted Uber and were no help making it work again. Dissapointed!
It doesnt double check on the placement of orders and I placed one accidentally. But canceled it within 3 seconds..still havent got the $17 refund. How can a restaurant start preparing for an order which was still being processed by the app itself. I could see the green thing buffering. Thats shady. I wonder how much Uber Eats steals money through accidental orders?!!
Its easyand reliable I like it
Please at Hobart KFC and hungry jacks
First time and last ! My order cold missing food sides ... French fries cold ! 🤦🏻‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️
Tonight I'm having anything I want!!!!
All these delivery apps suck now they want to charge you a service fee on top of a delivery fee and if you order something under $20 the what to charge you a small order fee so a $10 order will cost you $15+ dollars. And then they want you to tip yeah I could have tip them with the extra $5 you asking for them if a tip they say they are not getting the tips....smh ridiculous
"I have been using uber eats for a while, everytime i order the delivery partners i get are very unprofessional not to mention that alot of times they dont match their picture and dont even speak english. this happens too often than i can report and its not even compensated by a good service. I haven't eaten in like 20 hours and my uber ""delivery partner"" decided that it was better to put the order status as delivered instead of actually delivering the food. Its 5am tho so i guess ill just sleep!"
Good selection and easy to use. Would be 5 stars if more restaurants were available.
"Availability and menu selection = 4 Customer service = 1 Therefore, the rating averages out to 2.5 For a while this app seemed to monopolize the food delivery industry, after perfecting what JustEat was already doing. Now it faces numerous competitors, which makes me curious to why the customer service lacks so much. After a few bad interactions, I deleted the app."
Customer support will do whatever they can to avoid helping you. I received cold food but will not refund it unless you have a picture of it. I reheated it and ate it. Quality was horrible but I can't get help. I won't be using anymore.
Its awesome
Everything was great even tho o Kno for a fact my driver ate my fries smh but other then that everything was fine
"Can't use the new user promotional offer. There is two offer for new user, I used one and one remain."
Orders are pretty quick but the restuarants need to be more on point with accuracy especially given specific ordering directions. It's very inaccurate with the consistently missing items in orders that ultimately you can't do much about at the moment you receive your order....but especially for amount of money spent they need to provide better customer service( I have a big family to please) so anything left out could effectively ruin a whole meal....its very frustrating
Good rates compared to GrubDash
"So in Minneapolis, Minnesota, you can order Buffalo Wild wings but you can't actually get it? Please fix it. It doesn't say unavailable. You're able to order and everything. Otherwise a great app."
Easy to use. I like you can see progress of the driver getting your order. Discounts for delivery hi helps too.
"Used the app for the first time,when they got here it was raining so I grabbed my food and ran back in, wow all my food was wrong fifteen dollars of panda turned out to be fourty two of somebody else's order I'm pissed but I bet there pissed more"
"I have seen way too many times, my order being accepted by a driver that is way too far away. Eventually it gets assigned to another driver and an order that should take no more then 30 minutes becomes 1 to 2 hours long for delivery and my food comes cold. Please FIX this issue. Its aggravating."
"Had an incorrect order a few months ago and all i got back was the $3 of the incorrect portion of the meal. When you get a part of the meal wrong, the whole meal is ruined. I don't want $3 for the part of the meal that was forgotten. I want a full refund because my whole meal was ruined without a certain portion. Terrible service. Haven't ordered with them since"
Uber Eats has a great variety of options and the food arrives in a reasonable amount of time.
"They hiked up the delivery prices. Exponentially. My $12 order rounds up to near $21 after a ""service fee"" a ""delivery fee"" and a ""Small order Fee"" that's and additional $3 if yournotser is under $15. And then after you pay this absorbent amount of money, you end up getting an order that isnt even right in the end."
Garbage. Deleted it. Was trying to order all day breakfast with McDonald's and would not allow me to access breakfast because it was past 11 a.m. IT'S ALL DAY!!!! Had to leave and go pick it up when I went on this app to have it delivered. Trash!
Dope
"Everything was going well until for whatever reason my referral reward dropped 50%. After spending hours on the phone and emailing customer support, they were absolutely useless. Horrible customer service. I recommend Skip. Less expensive too."
Cool
Ratas
"Useless when you need help, just like deliveroo, no one cares and its all online, no real human help"
Niiiiiiiiiiice ass
"This has to be the WORST delivery app in Australia. Their customer service is useless and their riders dont have a clue of what they are doing. Cant even make a delivery when the restaurant is 5 mins away from the place of delivery. Surely the drivers do this on purpose so they can get your order for themselves. Useless, use MenuLog or Deliveroo."
My order is always missing something but it's not to bad a service and some of the drivers are rude.
"The orders are great but they claim that there is a hold and take out the tip twice, this has happened to me twice. If this continues I will not give a tip on the app but in cash to driver. Or maybe I will see if the media will like to hear about the double charging."
Use eats-claudem147ue to get free food when first signing up
Great!!
Easy to use app. Decent selection
I DO NOT RECOMMEND! The customers service is terrible! No one was able to deliver my food and the company refused to give me my money back for the delivery fee and service fee.
Lord they come through even its after hours I ordered a ton that would feed families and still pay a reasonable flower They cool they leggit and do on the quickness I order so much that i should be worried about my fitness.
"I placed an order with Sushi Zushi. I waited 40 minutes and it was cancelled. The whole 40 minutes the order showed it was being prepared then show a driver was picking it up. The order was then cancelled. I ordered the same order again, waited, then cancelled. I ordered a third time and the exact thing occurred. All 3 times the app shows the driver is picking up then its cancelled. This was ridiculous."
Great
Seriously shoddy customer service
Awsome customer service
Delevery is superb ...nice app
You all should start delivery in anchorage in alaska....doordash has
Did not want 9.99 charge for promotion
Not sure why all my friends still get free delivery promotions and I don't? Would love to know the answer uber.
Perfect.
Drivers get lost with simple instructions
Garbage app doesn't load up with Uber. Never works right. please God what happened to delevery drivers
Keeps crashing can't order anything
Pretty cool
"Prático e fácil de usar, bons restaurantes cadastrados."
Totally horrible. This is the second time i ordered and they said they where running late. And all of a sudden. Cancelled my order for no reason. Second time you guys did this to me...you suck. Doordash is a 10000 times better than you. I am currently deleting your app......
Like in muddy paddle
"Im disappointed innthe order I JUST RECEIVED. My children's food was missing from the order. Then, when i tried to report it, i just got a blank screen"
"I literally just waited over an hour including, them calling letting me know to be late and then cancel after an extra 30min wait F*** this"
"Love Uber Eats and it's seriously one of the best creations in the last few years! Only bad experience I had was a delivery woman ate my burger from McDonald's, but both McDonald's and Uber Eats helped me resolve the situation. Same woman dropped off the return burger! 😂 Karma Chameleon. 😁 And sometimes I don't get everything I ordered, but that's the restaurant's fault. Uber Eats can bang my wife! (If I had one... 🤭)"
Good
I have never had an account but it says my phone number has been used maybe from a previous owner how do I get it changed
Placed an order and waited for an hour before finding out no cars were available. A notification of lack of delivery people in the Uber Eats app sure would have been nice.
Loaction is Not Acurate like Taxi App. Taxi App Issues also they take to Eats app Teribal. No Helpline to call like in Eats App in Taxi App too
I can't delete payment options. As soon as I hit a payment on file it automatically bi-passes the 3 dot screen
I didnt get my food they just took my money first time bad experences
Works as advertised- will use again
"I ordered from a major chain restaurant (red Robin) and their signature whiskey River BBQ burger came without BBQ sauce. It's in the friggin name! They made me pick every single ingredient like I was a friggin subway. Apparently I missed the BBQ option. Make a standard option, seriously. This was the last one, there are now officially no good food delivery companies out there. Order local, folks, have them deliver locally. This is a bloody waste of money and time."
Cool
Horrible
The app always guides drivers behind my building for delivery
Keeps saying server error.
Very reliable and useful.
Will re-rate this when it installs. No issues with other apps.
App doesnt show all the restaurants that are available. Format has changed. No way to contact support except for an issue with an order. Have used this app for too long to have problems now. Second guessing the uber pass. Gold membership obviously means nothing.
I have the service with uber will tell all my friends
Gave a four because I had to order cutlery which I didn't want and got charged for it.thats a scam
Tracking food is great
It great a little glitchy on andriod but i think its great
Very easy to order food.
First time user...love it. .super convenient when I do not want to leave my hotel room.
So far so good
It's great. Awesomely convenient. I just wish there was a way to tip the restaurant staff directly.
Account acts up
These fees are crazy on uber eats. Ridiculous
"I like Uber eats but I hate their app. It keep closing down, and I have to restart all the time, it is very frustrating. Usually when this happens I order from another food delivery company. They should fix the problem or otherwise they will lose lots of clients."
"Easy to use, looks it'd locations"
Not good at all had only half are meal delivered my parnter has tried to get in contact with them and Is still waiting to hear if them .
Awesome experience so far
Free delivery disappears before I can put in order
App is great. We will see about the order!
"I didn't get the food i orderfrom you and this is the second tim this was done,if i pay you over fift dollar is think i will get what i order Dmi Cash"
Good Servive
Great
Great app
The delivery and food were great.
There's no places available
"Overpriced and bad service. Can't count how many times they mess up an order or cancel an order after an hour. I also know they make restauraunts pay a ridiculous price to use them while paying their drivers scrap. Honestly Favor, Door Dash, Postmates, and so many alternative make me not use this app."
Good
"Soooo useful especially for when I can't travel where I want for food and can't leave work. However, there's an issue of the app not detecting that I'm home and not at work and keeping the address I select. It'll let me select the address but revert back to a different one. Other than that, it's really good."
"App never works on my samsung galaxy s8, i have to uninstall and re-install everytime i want to use the app, otherwise it just constantly loads on start up."
"Terrible customer service, will be avoiding in future never again..."
Delivery guys on bike that go up one way streets and go on pavements to cycle and nearly knocking over OAPs should be banned. Reported this to customer service and can't do anything without a ID number. No way to to catch them. All staff should have hivis tops with ID numbers like a reg plate
No connection to the 1800... support number provided. Therefore was unable to provide feedback on service frpm this app.
Just a great spp
Why tuwaik district in Riyadh is not covered by uber eats I cannot order here please cover it soon
Something is always left off my order and its hard to reach anybody for help
We didn't recieve our order. the driver didnt deliever our order we waited for a long time even now still waiting but the status said delieved. We wasted our money a lot of money for an order that never came
"Bom aplicativo até precisar de atendimento, atendentes super despreparados"
Easy to navigate.
"Delivery time changes so often, more than one hour wait.. ."
"Had a very terrible experience, order #98D65. How Uber support dealt it left me shocked."
So fast just awesome
"Usually on point with my orders. Sometimes things are forgotten or not correct but hey, nobody is perfect."
dope
ood experiences
Excellent service
"Lo desinstale hace tiempo por desuso, lo vuelvo a usar y no puedo pasar de la dirección porque me marca error. De nuevo a desinstalar"
Pretty good first experience... However gotta watch out for those fees... 15% service fee on my Friday order... Thankfully I had a coupon for that amount and could tip the delivery guy
Very good place to order deliveries. Very transparent. Always kerping you up to the minute on your order
My food is always on time and it's always hot I love
Very very good.
"Great App, Easy to use"
LOVE IT!!!
Got banned
service charge made it a 4
"I am new to this app, my friends always talk about how easy was to get food on your doorstep. But it's really frustrating when it comes to log in only on your uber eats account. It doesn't let me log in and after I enter my email it says ""It's already in use"". This app needs a log in option for more easy use. Please help me and everyone that has this issue and I will rate 5☆"
"Serviço mal prestado, motoboys sequestram os pedidos, pedidos cancelados sem mais nem menos, sempre atrasa, nao existe suporte técnico!"
Best thing ever
My pasta was wrong.....no drinks delivered!! My 1st order on uber eats and not very impressed!!
"They do no vetting on their drivers... had a driver park up somewhere then turn up 30 mins late to have him and his passenger intimidate me 😂 then they want me to message them the issue, sick of this app now and all the issues"
Entre refus de remboursement pour des commandes erronés et des livreurs qui ne font pas leur travaillent. Ce système est défaillant. Décevant. Très mauvaise expérience.
Awesome delivery time and great food. Courteous delivery person.
"Horrible Customer Service! First time user of the app, and of course an issue with the first order. I've contacted Customer Service via chat, I've spent 20 mins trying to resolve the issue. The CSR's responses were very slow and she (Patricia) decided at the end that she doesn't want to resolve the issue and left the chat. So unprofessional! I've asked the issue to be escalated and she advised that chat is monitored!? This was such a disappointing experience! Never ever again Uber services!!!"
Unable to contact driver. Order was scheduled for delivery by 1235 and the driver is still accross town according to the app.
Great
Always delivers in time specified. No issues flagged to date. Does what it says on the tin.
CT
Terrible. My whole experience was not up to par at all.
Very convenient and good services
"Was good in the beginning. Then, I had a bad delivery, they never picked the food up. After 45-60mins they reassigned a new driver without asking whether I wanted it or was still available to receive it another 45mins later. I called Uber Eats, they stated, ""they will refund me for the 1st charge but will not refund me for the second because it's on it's way!"" I explained that I had to be to work at 11:30am and I had ordered the food around 9am and ETA was Noon. Horrible service BEWARE!!"
No customer service number
"I am constantly having issues with drivers canceling my orders, saying they completed the orders but never do, and when you call customer support your connected with someone overseas (I live in the US) who can't or won't help you. I was just told by the customer support agent that her confirmed with the restaurant that my food was never picked up and still waiting to be delivered but that since the driver put that the order was delivered/completed they can't assign another driver for my order"
"Good, just wish there were more choices for restaurants by me in CT"
"Very expensive and delivery services are not good. Better off walking to the restaurant's to save the long wait, extra charges and cold food when delivered!"
Thanks uber. I never felt hungry again.
Great app
Love it!!
It was ok ....felt alil embarrassed because how the driver came off but hey
Uber/Zomato ROCKS
Verrry useful when I just wanna stay home on a lazy day. Its the perfect combination!
It is really unclear if you are or not receiving items on your order. I cant eat onions and when I order from subway it defualts to having onions even though I select not having them. Still shows up at checkout when im ready to pay. Not a risk I'm taking.
"This app is great, everything is clear and easily understood. It's quick and efficient and there are many restaurants to choose from ; it's great."
"Bring back eats to india bcz Zomato is useless, they don't have the service quality like you and doesn't listen to coustomers even if sends the proof. So don't sell your business to them and bring eats back to india."
Good
I was scared at first but I love this app and it's convenience
Just awesome
😁
User friendly app
"Disgusted by the service i received tonight. Ordered never arrived, though saying delivered. The app told me to phone which i did only to be told it couldn't be resolved by a person only a message! I then messaged and after initial reply had no further contact from them over 45 minutes. I have been forced to order and pay again as i have an autistic son who has gone into a meltdown over this. Please can someone from UBER have the decency to respond."
Still waiting for outcome
Excellent service
"Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!! ordered ubereats , it said it was delivered, it never was and I have to wait 3 to 4 days to get my money back after waiting an hour for my food. And they just said that's the best I can do. Hopefully uber shuts down between, all the sexually harassment of women passengers and their horrible customer service they don't deserve anyones business"
I appreciate the service and with the extra added benefits options. Would recommend. Spend more time in app due to the variety of options
"After Uber eats merged with Zomato, the trust with Uber cannot be build again. Zomato cheats it's customers, so switched over to Uber Eats. Now with no options left relying on other options. ☹️☹️☹️"
I really don't like waiting an extra half an hour to an hour and a half because the delivery driver is on a bike ..
Closed
It is a good experience.
"The app wont even work now, doesnt let me enter my address and only shows this page asking for a new address for delivery when I restart the app. It wont let me search for my address even when I put it in. It's useless if it's so expensive and is always breaking. I have no way of getting lunch for me and my kids today."
"Horrible...I waited for 1.45 hour,but my food never arrived ... uninstalling this and plz don't install this app... their service is pathetic"
Great App!
The delivery was insanely quick!
Stop sending sms messages if you don't support replies to respond with your very own Opt out option provided in the sms!!!!!!
Works fine for the most time.
"Easy to use and let's you pick up, which is nice!"
Gives me food
"Very professional, friendly and prompt."
Excellent service
Fine. Easy to use and track the order. Could do with more variety of restaurants and better offers. Also you increased the delivery charge but no improvement to justify paying more.
Its coming in handy
If you use this app prepare yourself for great disappointments. My orders have been cancelled multiple times after waiting for close to two hours. The order sometimes is delivered with missing items and you are required to pay the full amount inclusive of the missing item. Low grade customer service. Keep off if you are serious about ordering timely meal deliveries!
I love Uber eats it's making my life easier
Great convenient
Could've rated 5 stars but the price of the food is clearly priced much higher on the app. All things considered great UX and fast delivery times... happy customer!
Great service
Horrible! I tried UBER Eats for the first time and both service quality and support service is aweful!
Prices and fees are too high for food that arrives cold and nasty.
Awesome ....
good very good good food
It's great app with multiple needs which we all expecting nowadays.
No option to sign in existing user? Bologna if you ask me.
💗👏🏻
Best food delivery ever!
"I've used UberEats 3 times, two of those were missing an item and their response is to tell me I'm lying so they can't work with the restaurant to see why this happened. There must be a better mechanism for validating orders before delivering the food. This seems like a fundamental part of this service which is missing. EDIT: I reached out after the dev reply only to have them again tell me they can't do anything. If they could get my order right it wouldn't be an issue!"
Great
Hey it Saaudria I love your app
Nice dude
Good app
"The problem with using this is once you add the delivery fee, service fee then tip you have easily just added an additional 10.00 to your total which is not always worth it. But otherwise if you dont mind paying more for your food its very convenient especially if you are sick or busy this can be very helpful."
Great job to my driver...
It's user friendly 💯
Not working uber eats
Good
"This is no reflection on the incredible app, but instead on the more than inadequate customer support after a positively ridiculous experience. We ordered 2x smoothie bowls from kauai on the app. They arrived upside down, and 90% of the contents spilled in the paper bag. The driver left without comment. On informing UberEats - including pictures - they refunded us for only one saying - and I quote ""We know that you’re not happy with how your dish looks, however we also understand that giving you a credit doesn’t prevent this from happening again."" What?!! There are no words."
very good
Effortless!
Best
Good service
I cant acces my account
Best thing ever
"Easy to use with plenty of options, products are well described and have pictures. Best part is getting delicious food delivered to my house 😋"
Explicit every time when I'm at work. But you don't deliver at my house which my fall.
"Getting board of all these ""technical problems"" we get it, you're a tech company so all the problems are technical, maybe try to fix them? Get ready for orders not being collected, cancellations, promotions that they email to you not working, a whole load of wasted time then to top it off absolutely awful customer support, they won't talk to you unless it's a active order, the faq and email support is pointless, they just don't help you, it's designed to make you give up. Don't waste your time"
NO SIRVE ES PA NADA
Poor
Forces you to give them all your personal details before even telling you if the service is in your area. Then it tells you that you can't use their service as your house is about 5cm outside their stupid zoning rules. It's like the inventor of gerrymandering set this up. There's tonnes of Uber eats people running around in our town I'm sure they would be happy to take a few steps further to cover the whole town instead of just the few houses that happen to be inside this apps weird shaped zone
good like
Please stop sending me promotional text messages.
Over all app is pretty good my only criticism is customer support. Takes a long time for them to respond and usually problems are unsolved. For every issue customer support say we are sorry and that's the end of it.
"Is great when it works. Sometimes you will place an order, set a time ,wait, wait some more , check your phone just to realize your orders hast been canceled with no notification. Leaving you hungry and very angry."
Very easy😊
The convenience of not having to drive or walk to a restaurant and stand in queues is a dream come true.
Nice
Good
The app itself isn't too bad but the service is terrible. 2 Drivers collected my orders and cancelled at the very end for bogus reasons. They did not even return my food to the restaurant they just made off with it. There is no way to complain on the app because the driver cancelled and the trip was never completed. The option for rating the order only comes up after delivery. I waited 2 and a half hours before the second delivery eventually cancelled and I was still without food.
This is the worst app the server doesn't respond properly
Easy to use and great prices
Nice and prompt service
"Предполагаемое время ожидания одно, а по факту ожидать минут на 20 больше. Курьер может спокойно взять другой заказ, а апка тебе напишет ""этот заказ помогает нам уменьшить расходы"", но чьи расходы? Убера? Спасибо, я рада знать, что ожидаю на 20 минут дольше ради того, чтобы есть холодную еду и съэкономить уберу бабла за свои деньги."
"Awful customer service. They refuse to refund money when you receive an incorrect order or don't receive your order at all. Contacting them is impossible and when you do, you get the same automated reply. Never using this app again."
"Bad service, defect app, bad company, thiefs"
"User friendly, like the tracking of your order and the app noticing your change of location easily."
Drivers are always quick and friendly. App has never given any problems and is a joy for the lazy person. Always great to order with uber eats !
Far better than zomato or any other app ❣️
good
Never concentrating on instructions and delivery always late
Exceptional
The app works perfectly but not available everywhere
Great
Useless
Once set up the Uber Eats app works pretty well but some functions aren't easy during order process such as deleting items from cart or making changes . Maybe it gets easier to navigate with experience or times used.
"Great app, becoming more expensive than its competitors though. Please add more restaurants"
good
I'm not able to login into this app... Tried many times. Through number and email... Both failed
Gd
No offer
"The only reason it gets a 4 star rating is because uber eats does not deliver to my home location🙁.. so I can only use it when I'm at work... thought it would've changed by now because it's been like that since uber eats came into existence... dont understand why.. because if you can pick up passengers at my location, why can't you deliver food... But other than that I love this app and always use it at work.. please just dont be too extravagant with the extra rands you put on the food"
It's an app that gets you food. That deserves 5 stars 😂
"First order was fine, second order the food was rolling about in the driver's bag opened and soaked in coffee. I refused delivery and the dishonest driver marked as delivered. Contacted support through the app chat and got no answer, phoned customer service and told It can only be dealt with through the app and no resolution given. Very disappointing and will not use uber eats again."
ভালো
McDonald's breakfast delivery as soon as I get up need I say more
"F*""#*ing app.Was useful once but now its just a piece of sh*#.It is owned by ZOMATO then why this freaking app is still here."
Very bad
No discounts.I am uninstalling it
Delivery was not good service if we order any foods any place suppose to be we can't take that food same place uber should be deliver where we want exact place but what uber are doing there cancelling the order and there charging the amount of what we order its not good service
Lovely
"Terrible Trying to order through app but payment doesn't go through even entered the right credit card details twice. Still doesn't work, trying to pay by credit card and pay pal both doesn't work, even I m using pay pal for last 15 years. Please sort this out. Thanks"
Server error then I was charged for order I never received .
"App is frustrating to use as it forced me to tip. I was trying to decide on top amount and 10 seconds in, 5he app just picked for me and it wouldn't let me change it."
This is an excellent application and an excellent and a committed service.
"Horrible first experience. Estimated delivery time was supposed to be 45 minutes. An hour after that and a 2nd driver assigned, still no food and then the order was cancelled. The customer service chat support assured me I would not be charged. No offer to mitigate the 2 hours lost time and irritation of going to bed hungry. No way to contact drivers like you can on GrubHub. Ineffective and non caring customer service department. Dont use this app, there are better options available."
"If your order doesn't turn up don't expect a refund (Reply to developer: I did contact them they don't care,)"
Bloody helll Very poor condition of delivery. Each and every time they destroy food and and keep us starve.
Love the app. Only issue I have is the place order button being on the bottom of the screen. Accidentally pushed it when I meant to go back to my home screen so I could order later on. Needs to be moved so you can't push it when trying to use your phones home or back button.
Nice
Very good experience
"Going from back to worse all the time, they send a lot of Spam mail with ""discounts"" and ""promos"" but when you want to use it *you are not eligible for this promo* the delivery is always late and they keep sending you ""€8 for the delay"" that you also can't use, missing drinks or food from your order and nobody answers for it, poor customer service, way more expensive than other apps, many fees, so I decided to stop using it, definitely not worth it."
Took them 2 hours to deliver food from 3 miles away. They wanted to keep everything but the tip and discount when i tried to cancel. The food never got delivered. After calling customer service they did refund the full amount. Still very unsatisfied with the service. I will use Doordash from now on. The estimated 30 minutes and were early for the delivery.
Don't use it. Waste of time. Better use our local apps alot better than this fancy pancy Uber eats. Failed to deliver and had the audacity of lying.
Cancled order after 3 hours. Terrible service. Rude customer service
The best survice
"If you pay for delivery, they make your driver deliver to other people first, anyways. They dont refund mistakes, just say sorry. They dont read your complaints, just auto-respond. They dont compensate your time or care about their customers or drivers at all. They only care about money. Good luck and have fun with this ""service."""
My account is now tied up with ZOMATO just because I am not part of Uber Eats before 1 July 2019. What was the matter?
"The worst ever! The dam customer service wont help, and they dont know what they are doing. They make you pay a fee of $19 to cancel a delivery no matter what the price is. It is just a dumb company dont waist your time or money on this"
Nice
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Price on Uber Eats is higher than ordering direct from store. Not sure if this controlled by Uber or by the food outlet - will retract if it's out of Uber Eat's control. Delivery fee getting close to double figures ($8) for most options. I get you need to make money, but $8 is more than half price of most meals that's on offer. End up calling the store and getting delivery for $5 or less."
Worse ever food cold when it arrived a hour n some mins after i ordered
Not the best at all sucks had no problem taken my money.now it wont allow me to order any food. Fix problem please. I screenshot this as well. Maybe my lunch Can be on you after you fix problem
Good
Good Delevari
"Totally waste, Uber eats was a great app to order any food but nowadays it is a trash because of bugs. Now it's time to uninstall this trash I can't able to login, when i click on login nothing happens just in the same page. I uninstalled the app and tried but it didn't work"
"Made an order for a restuarant that was shown as still in business hours on the app, driver went out to pick it up, got to the location, and was told by the GM that the kitchen had closed 3 hours before hand. I was told this after I called the restaurant to see why the order was cancelled, also informed me that Uber had been notified about the hours and still no changes to the hours on the app."
Good
"Constant problems getting the correct order or a delivery person by car, and now with the surcharge in Chicago this app is comically overpriced and under serviced."
Good
Works well
Good customer support.
I got the wrong order
Not worth it.
Excited about this new servy
"Very poor customer service. I will not use uber eats again. They tell you your order will arrive at a certain time, and never shows up, then they want to charge you half for booking order."
"As a frequent flyer/eaterathome I am allways looking for new places to order from , my experiences with uber eats have been positive for most part ."
"Someone hacked my account and now I can't access it (even with resetting my password). And the 2 credit/debit cards that were connected to it have had fraudulent charges on them, so I had to close both and get new ones."
Bad swafftwear
Best invention ever!
"Everytime i make an order no matter what location, when im ready to checkout, it says ""SERVER ERROR - ORDER LOCATION TOO FAR FROM STORE"" and yet it allows me to put the address in and add items to my cart."
Worthless
"Garbage!!! Ordered two meals, they didn't call email or anything to tell us THEY canceled the order .. nothing was special about it .. them to find a contact number omg impossible I had to call the driver line to get transferred .. it's rediculous on-top of the extra fees I decided to try this app one last time ... Never again .. I'll take a cab to the store next time .. less headache totally worth it"
Fast delivery
I got it and I'm scared to get food because I'm thirteen
"I've tried rebooting, reinstalling, and clearing the app cache - it refuses to show me anything other than the ""enter a new address"" field"
Mi ubicación no es exacta y siempre marca una o dos cuadras de distancia de donde estoy realmente
Worst customer service.
"I'm hungry and can't leave the house for medical reasons and your app keeps saying ""unknown error"". It's worked in the past on my previous phone but I'm extremely annoyed that it won't work when I actually need it."
"Its nice, easy to use."
"I order from ONE restaurant on Uber Eats, and I order from literally almost every night. How about the one they time my order was messed up, i solved the problem myself before hearing back from Uber Eats? Fix the communication, and I'll change my rating"
Very good app
Interactive look & feel.. Like that
"Absolute trash. This is only as good as the drivers and restaurants in you're area. If you live in the hampton roads area of Virginia, dont bother. Drivers dont fallow simple instructions, take the max time to deliver. Resulting in cold food. Then you have the restaurants getting your order wrong with missing major items or just having the order wrong. This happened 3 times in a row. Drove the food back and was refused refund from restuarant and Uber. Even after returning the food."
"You can spend about $30 on a meal that was ruined by the delivery person but Uber will give you a $5 credit. Oh yeah, and my food was delivered by a person on a ""BICYCLE"" who had to cross several lanes of traffic to get to me. And no, you don't get the option to not let someone deliver your food by means of a bicycle. This may be ok in NYC but I live in Tampa, FL."
More free options than before
Food is always hot. Service is always good.
have had 2 or 3 missing items from my order and the past two times I've had safety concerns. Contacting ubereats is to no avail they send you generic emails with absolutely no customer service involved. Tonight was Last Straw half of my order was missing and what we did get with an edible because it was raw chicken. I requested a full refund and received $8 out of $53. I am done with ubereats it is obvious customers are not their top priority. I will definitely be reporting the food safety issu
Awesome for people too lazy or too busy to eat 😁
never have had an order come in accurately
Love it! Very user friendly and efficient
Cool
Everytime I order food driver gets sent to wrong address I gotta call driver and chase him down to get my food
Very easy to use
Great thanks 👍
"Quick delivery, courteous driver and HOT FOOD"
They provide too little time to cancel orders and charge you whole price. So annoying.
Coupon invalid. Bad bad app. scam
Deceptive pricing due to hidden fees that inly show up at the end. .
Great!
"Entregador não confirmou o pagamento e agora o app está me cobrando, e para melhorar é impossível entrar em contato com o suporte."
Orders missed item. You can't contact with rider after he go. Also no customer care answer. More than 50% from order missed stupid service
....worst app ever!! The app can't find my location so I can't place an order ffs!!
Did not sync my location and sent food to another location
"Fizemos um pedido pelo Ubereats e não recebemos nossa comida. O estabelecimento alega que não pode fazer nada, o 0800 do aplicativo não nos atende. Agora estamos em contato com a operadora do cartão para estorno da compra."
Everytime i used it they were late. Food was cold. They got lost and i called uber eats for a refund and they said they can't. And the driver never showed. So i didn't get my food or a refund. Im never using this app again.
Great service and very nice people
"App had issues with my internet connection, didn't show or notify my first order or it's duplicate, I made a different order and when I checked I had spent almost 100 in food and had 3 different orders coming my way, tried cancelling them but there's no option through the app after it pairs you a driver. Called the restaurant with the latter order and they said I had to call Uber, did research and ubereats has no phone line support. Very very unreliable"
Love it
"My app is stuck on the delivery address page. I type in my address but nothing happens. I've uninstalled/reinstalled, updated etc. Nothing. I've used Uber Eats before no issues, so I know the problem is on your end."
Has anyone ever ACTUALLY recieved the $7 off your first Uber Eats when your friend sends you a link and you creat an account? I didn't get the promised discount when I signed up for Uber after a referral and I now I haven't gotten it when I downloaded Uber Eats. Seems like a scam to get downloads.
Came really fast cold and they forgot the baby's drink so only 3 star as its my first use
My app is stuck on the delivery address page.
I'm loving it. The food is good and the service is affordable.
scammers!! underpaying the delivery partners ! and creating risk for customers!
Nice when you dont want to cook or go out
"I spent 33 pound on my order today and the food came cold and some items were missing so i called customer service. Waited almost 20 minutes for someone to be available to talk. Eventually they picked up, spoke to the manager Malik he was unhelpful and rude."
Great service and fas
Ones you order something be prepared to receive text messages EVERYDAY. blocking the number does nothing cause they will send a message from another number.
"I love that you can track the orders and the driver vehicles, but not having a customer service number for when things go wrong drives down the rating for me."
It's good. It's getting much better w/ every update.
The food is always on time
perfectly ok. I place order from Nigeria to America
"Delivery came late, Food was so cold and also they forgot the fries Called customer service they were very rude specially Malik the manager"
Bht bekaar app hai existing customers ke liye bar bar new sing in Karo
Easy to use.
"It is a good app with bad customer service. I had a food item missing I made a complaint and there was no response from their side, not a care in the world. Edit: Yes, they responded after three to four days and my money was refunded but i would have preferred to get the food. But for their response I change my mind from two to four stars. Thank you."
Awesome 👍
Reliable! Fast! Great Customer Service!
Good
Always works well for me great indications on times etc
The worst app to ever exist
M 5
I ordered Kfc using the App and never received my food. I still got charged and Uber Eats refused to refund my money cuz the driver reported delivered I got scammed 😔
Not covering my area
Nice app
"I eat only here, please give me free credit mr. uber"
Work as should be
Very fast and efficient. The service is excellent.
Too great a service!
good Job 👍
"I'am unable to use application becuse of outstanding amount in my account as i was trying to us uber for taxi for the first time and taxi driver cancelled the trip. Amount only 12 egp and iam welling to pay but application doesn't accept my order while they can easily add debit value on it ,after many tries i deleted uber Eats application. Also i tried to pay online by my credit card by they refuse my CCD as it wasn't register in you App at the end i delet it. Other application more easier."
"O Aplicativo travou, meu pedido foi realizado de uma maneira que foi financeiramente desvantajosa para mim e não consegui resolver pois o atendimento da Uber Eats é péssimo, impessoal e robotizado."
"Brilliant, always and every time."
App works as intended
"I couldn't get a particular item and instead of offering help, the driver who barely spoke a word of english said ""not my folate"" (think it's supposed to be fault lol) and would take about 10 mins to send me a 3 worded reply. All I wanted was to know how to get a refund, and he was being rude and useless. Will never use again."
"Had a very bad experience ordering through the app, none of the customer service number provided in the app is working, the restaurant number shown was also wrong. Nothing went right. Seems Uber eats never care the customers at all."
good.
Efficient and reasonably priced
"Love the convenience of the app, the variety and the customer service has always been prompt and helpful."
used to be really good service is now extremely poor and app hardly works
"Quick delivery, top service"
I spoke to the supervisor who lied to me about me not getting a soda. All I wanted with my meal was a soda!!! This is ridiculous!!!!!
#NAME?
What kind of delivery app cannot deliver to my address? Joke of a company
First time using it and It great
Best services
Cupons não funcionam. Se vc cancelar vai ficar sem comida e vai ter que pagar por ela. Um absurdo.
It's perfect
Thanks a lot
Took my payment and failed to deliver my food but that OK because they will put it back in 3 to 5 days that bound to help me now. Can't even complain because they don't deal with that in that department. Will never use uber eats again. Customer service statement of the day is Try to understand. AMAZING
Can't use it keeps ask me to enter a new address and nothing happens after that
Nice
"Awesome, free delivery promos all the time....."
"Sólo errores y errores. Mi pareja y yo nos descargamos la aplicación para aprovecharnos de los coupones de descuento, pero me imagino a alguien que quiera usarla de manera cotidiana y la desinstalaria por desperación. Está muy mal actualizada, no deja de dar fallos con mensajes tipo ""el sitio está lejos de la direccion"", cuando en realidad te pone eso porque has añadido algo al carro que no está disponible, pero la app no te lo pone, cada vez que tengo que pedir es como hacer un puzzle. Horrible"
"Bad , I order something and the food was so bad from the restaurant, i try to get credit for so nasty food, support send an e mail that they can credit $4.00 dollars, very bad app and support"
Sar please hamare yaha uber eats nahi hai please yaha par bhi layiye uber eats location palwal
"Best service, aff delivery, very efficient 👌🏾👌🏾"
So far so good i can send food to my Mr. While he's at work.
It doesnt deliver to slovenia
Awseome
When I try to put on my contacts it says something went wrong
Great app
got food- am happy
Why when it's my first order I get a 15 quid of over 20 quid and it say I already used it when I have no order
"Fantastic app until it goes wrong and you need ""help"" followed all of the instructions as to complain about my order but still waiting for a reply I was given the wrong food and what I was given was dry,overcooked and inedible I was left with 3 very hungry children and had to make something for them to eat they take your money straight away and the ""customer service "" is disgusting I want my money back please and I just hope that this doesn't happen to somebody else"
"Pésimo servicio al cliente, tuve un problema con una orden que no llegó y no me reembolsaron mi dinero."
Great app for getting fat!
Gimme my food now! Thanks to uber eats its possible.
Love it
Does not work.
"I had so many experiences where the place prepares my food but the driver doesnt pick it up but drives of sonewhere else, I cant cancel it because they have prepared my food and i cant contact the driver because he has not picked up my food. Im left stuck and I cant order any food or cancel this guys ive waited over 1hour almost he has not even picked it up."
Why this app no in Yanbu 😪💔
"Useless app. Uber has my card details and address but can't seem to sync. No restaurant options just delivery details and a ""notify me"" map location."
No complaints. Drivers always polite and great food.
The best of the best!
Good
Is Uber eats still exists?
Loved it
Love love uber eats! Great App and great service! Recommend highly!
"New update doesn't allow to order in a specific restaurant. Lately Uber only makes foolish decisions, bad service, ..."
The best ever
"Doesn't let you point your exact location, only automatically by GPS or writing the address. There's no way to edit or delete your past used locations. The service fee of 15% its quite high makes you think twice before ordering."
Fast delivery and more discounts
Good
Won't let me purchase food
Ok
"It is so fast, easy and also delicious 😍 Also on a day you don't want to cook uber eats ie probably the best and cheapest thing to do"
Great App. Delivery is always prompt and polite. Messaging to delivery drivers makes for avoiding so many headaches.
Ordered using this app my order never came I called support line and was Instructed to fill out some form through the app I did this and still recieved no food and better yet was not refunded
Theres no option to cancel the order when the restaurant takes too mich time to accept the order. Had to wait a long time to see it ......
I've had more than one incorrect order or orders never delivered. They offer no option for getting your money back or a number to call to talk to customer support. I feel bad for the poor restaurants and customers that lose money off this terribly run app.
Awesome app easy to use and great deals to best... uber eats is awesome
"Annoying! I've looked on every article about how to delete payment methods, and they all say to tap the ""three dot icon"" to delete payment methods, but no such icon exists and I cannot tap on them to do so. I tried updating the app, thinking that would correct the problem, but that was not the case. Now what?"
excellent
Great app
App doesn't work for me
My number isnt working so I cant order
"I'd rather just delete the whole app. They over charge you for everything. Your food can be $20 and they're charging you $35 for service fees, taxes, delivery etc. Like gosh for an extra $15 bucks that I'm paying you to bring me my food I could buy another meal and pick it up for free."
Worst app I can't login I forgot my password and option of forgot password does not work
Quite a lot of bugs in the app (tried with multiple phone and with multiple restaurants)
"Wonderful, exelent"
Kind of nice
Was working just fine and then today I couldn't order even from a McDonald's that is 0.8 miles away because my location is too far apparently. *in response to uber's reply: I ordered from door dash literally right after and all of the same restaurants that wouldn't let me order on your app were fine on door dash. So your response doesn't make sense.
Life spoiled by zomato come back uber eats....
"Три заказа подряд в течение недели их ""курьеры"" просто оставили себе: после получения курьером заказа мгновенно статус сменился на доставлено. ТРИ ПОДРЯД КАРЛ! Поддержка отвечает минимум сутки, максимум доходило до трёх дней. Деньги возвращаются около недели, хотя спасибо, что вообще возвращают. Без каких-либо извинений и компенсаций, естественно. В общем, категорически не рекомендую."
"The buy one get one , did not apply, reached out, was given a refund an extra meal, tried to use the credit and they failed twice chowing money from my card instead. It is a good app but they must fix some bugs."
"Can't update bank details, can't delete account. No way of contacting, absolutely sh!/e customer service."
Login issue
Ahhh I can't log in .. it keeps on saying my email is inappropriate
Recently i got 99% offer in my phone numbef when i try to add that prmo codr its say that ur not accpted or etc i need help
"App is kinda good, one issue is when i apply my discounts - they dont work at all"
Very good
Great. I would only recomend to put the delivery fee as a filter.
Sucks
I accidentally ordered food but in less than 5 seconds yet they charged for food
"Best App, Good customer service, Quick Response."
Easy to use and great layout
do not download it now it is acquired by zomato download zomato directly
No matter what the he is supposed to be it over charges. Customer service will run you around in circles and still do nothing even when you talk to the supervisor. It's consistently ridiculous I will no longer use this app I intend to uninstall use at your own risk and monitor your bank account. This has consistently happened with every order I've done if you want to make adjustments please do so and credited back to my credit card. I won't be using app again you
No sign in option Yes i know I'm registered. Give me the option to log in. Not just sign up
"A rider throws up inside my vehicle, I couldn't upload a photo through the application. But it always works when they need security checking. And they do every possible crook way to make it complicated."
"Try to make a account says already have one , try reset password says to me open app install app app says phone number doesn't have password linked to it send , submit a ticket ticket says can't submit how do you even have a account that has no password no email address linked to it ...........your website as so little functionality a 5 year could develop something better no cantact number nothing great service guys"
"I placed 2 orders on January 10th, 2020 one was placed in error. I immediately notified both the restaurant Suzy's Roti Parlour and Uber. The restaurant acknowledged that they recognized it was a duplicated order and will only send me one order. Which they did. They told me that one of the charges fir the canceled order will drop off my statement, that never happened. As a result I asked my bank to charge back the charge which they did, uber then proceeded to block my use of Uber Car Service"
"I'd say average, it's good."
good
"4 Main dishes missing and only delivered 1 salad, which i did not order. Driver is irresponsible."
Fraud !! You tell us promotion of 10€ and at the last you charge 5€ for the delivery and different service charges and at the final its same ! What's the use of promotion???? I tired to order a 20€ menu with 10€ promotion but at last I'm paying 19€ its useless!! You fraud
Keeps telling me my phone number is in valid and i can't place an order because of it
"I don't understand why ubereats is not accessible for me and my certain friends. Whenever I install ubereats it shows and redirect me to download zomato! I mean why though? I was really satisfied with ubereats until this happened! Did you all actually made ubereats inaccessible for us, 'Indians' ?"
"The app seemed to be malfunctioning and was switching to ""pick up"" everytime i set it to ""delivery"". I ended up getting ripped off because of this. No thanks. *after UberEats response-Why didn't customer service mention cache clearing when i asked for a refund? I had a few hundred orders and not one was for pick up. Funny how 1 star rating on your app gets me an answer but not when i politely asked to have the error rectified by customer service."
Love Uber eats!! Convenience to the max!
This is the worst app to ever exist!!! They give you a promo discount without specifying the parameters of the promo and then when you cancel because of the misinformation they want to charge you for something you never had!! Their support team is absolutely shocking and couldn't provide any actual support.
I received a 75 rands voucher but yet again I can add it on the app and it shows me that I have on applicable voucher and when I complete my order the voucher still does not work as my total amount due does not change. Is there a certain amount that I need to use for the voucher to apply?
"Unable to order, can't find location so won't let me order"
very breath takin .
Not exactly my order
I have just had enough with ubereats its not the same anymore. I have had too many bad experiences with horrible to no support. I have just stopped using their services and good riddance it was not worth losing my money on the horrible service.
Absolutely fuming! Tried for over 40 minutes to order food and kept refusing payment! On 3 different cards! Even deleted and re installed the app! Absoloute joke and made me miss the deadline on what i wanted to order! Thanks alot!
So far am enjoying this app and it's services 💃💃💖💞💃💃💝😘
Good but drivers don't find me as well as Otlob drivers
"This is the worst app I have ever used! I would have loved to order from Uber eats for the first time on my account, however I cannot add my cellphone number without it saying that I do not have a password for my account?? There is also no one to contact when wanting to ask a question or complain.."
First order with uber eats and its comes with 3 items missing.. logged a complaint and a week later and still nothing done. Try to leave feedback in the app and surprise surprise there seems to be a problem ! Try again later.... DONT THINK SO.... uninstalling - and TRYING to cancel account which is easier said than done... will never use again. Reply to Uber eats... I opened a complaint at the time and listed all items incomplete / missing.... still no reply... UBER EATS = DONT BOTHER
GOD JOB
Loving the promos
No me gusta cada vez q trato de entrar o registrarme no me deja ya no me deja entrar mas no me gusta de verdad me tiene por techo
"I wish they had a triple package available that had eats, scooters, & rides in Tampa."
Changed it to 1 star. Customer service is absolute garbage and there is no way to talk to anyone on the phone. ..............................................................Original review at 3 stars: it works and I like how you can stalk your driver but it keeps putting my home address in wrong and nothing I do changes it. >:[
Supper fast and convenient
Great
Why cant we delete the card without having to put another one? I used it to pay but not confortable leaving it on your systen that has to change!!!
The app will not allow me to login 😠
It was great
Good
company is not in india
"As I've updated UBER app. This one got all messed up. Reply: Hi, I've updated payment method in UBER app. When I moved to UBER Eats I couldn't open it for a long time. It kept asking for my address and wouldn't let me go to settings or anywhere else for that matter. Finally had to clear all cache and user settings from the system menu and login again until it fixed itself."
Great app always available drivers!
Great
Excellent application
Great app
"It's always failing when I try to add cards. In response to the answer. I tried the support contact from the app and all I got, was a blame shifting to my bank, from which I already added many cards. Thank you"
it Won't accept my cell phone number
Great service👍🏽
Fast and efficient delivery on point
Very good and helpful apps
Waste
Good. But im broke n fat now....
prices are ridiculous...at least for us in ca...door dash for the same exact order is honest to god 10 dollars cheaper get doordash you wont regret it ..also cant use my prepaid card with this app..but doordash does 👍
Awesome
Yummy
No offers at all
Very poor app. Unusable. I'm sure if it worked it would be great. Uninstalled after 5 minutes. *Edit* No way to login. It only asks for an email to register. As we opened an account before (deleted because of app problems) it says email already exists but it doesnt give any option to login. Reading through reviews this seems to be a very common problem. *Edit * Of course you use the same credentials. There is no where to put them though....No login!
Fake information.. cheater app
Fake compony
"Amazing drivers, considerate to the directions regarding delivery."
Superb
"Interesting that my last review wasen't here when I returned. ""Can't adjust the tip before ordering. Who tips someone before? Can't cancel after the food is ordered and the time is extended by the restaurant. In my instance from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. Phoned them afterwards and they were ""unable to cancel the delivery because it was confirmed by the restaurant"" a joke. Uninstalling. Even going to look into other alternatives for Uber."""
Drivers have been awesome.
I'm lovin it!
"Decent, could be better drop off prices but decent app for when you're hungry and you can't be bothered going out like a normal human"
Takes to long to deliver food and then its comes cold and missing items when you complain you dont get any help or refund app will be deleted dont use it try just eat instead. Thanks for your reply I've done the help in app and got told that food being 20 mins late is acceptable and food is in insulated bags but food was cold and missing 5 items still didn't get a refund .
Good
It's good and all but I then get messages telling me I have an outstanding Payment with my last order and the last time I checked I paid all the money in cash.
"Has the option to customize your order, unlike similar apps. e.g. more or less salt, or chili, or onions etc. I haven't used the add cutlery option, but for some it's invaluable! Imagine the disappointment! Ive discovered a favourite restaurant, and I can almost always use the free delivery option (nearby restaurants)so that's a bonus. Great for those who cannot get out to shop and cook on occasions. I tend to order a large main to share, and cook some extra veg at home. Great service thank you."
"The app will not accept paymemt. Have tried on two separate devices. Very poor app, first time user and thinking of never using again."
"Very convenient, good variety of food, easy to use"
Good
I can't login on this app because this app is very bad to work no backup option for our and password
So easy to order foods
Best app but some bugs sometimes location was not aquirecy plz check that and add some new features you improve this app this app will be a world best app
De best
Ordered food and the restaurant cancelled and still got charged for it.
Ots only useful when your at home and you cant contact the driver
Cant create a account with a number....annoying
One of the best application to experience a good quality food and service. I still love it
👍
Exceptional service great app and easy to use
"So I placed an order late at night bc I was late getting home from work. I thought everything was going fine until 2 hours later, my order gets dropped out of nowhere so here I am 2 hours later with no food and by now it's early morning and their reply was to order the food again 😠 no compensation or anything"
"Not user friendly. Not easy to change address if Google maps is wrong. Your app should conform to Canada Post standards not Google standards. It's obvious Google doesn't check addresses submitted to them, nor are they very quick about fixing their mistakes. I have now reduced my rating to one-star because all you did was passed the buck to some offshore supposed support department that doesn't even understand English. All your rhetoric is absolute BS!"
Fast and good service of chatting
It is a wonderfull app for order the foods in Ubereats
To: Uber Technologies Inc. There are numerous reasons why I state Eats is the worst food delivery app but the most offensive is your customer service team is unable( or at least stating so) to provide real resolutions to your customers issues/concerns. Feel free to contact me for email communications which serve as an example.
Fully making full this company.....don't use I'm install this app but suggest install zomato
"I cannot believe a big company like Uber has such a horrible customer service. I placed an order through the app and then about 9 minutes later i canceled it and ordered from other place. I understand that it's been 9 minutes and the restaurant has started getting the order ready, but why in the hell would you put the ""cancel order"" option there if you I'M STILL GONNA BE CHARGED FOR MY ORDER EITHER WAY. It doesn't make any f sense. If i know i would be charged either way why would i cancel it???"
Good
"Get Food Anytime! Or at lease some of it There have been so many instances of not getting my entire order that I can barely remember the few times I did! and it's always the drinks! If I order food after a UFC PPV for me and my friends one of us has to drive to the store ANYWAY to get something to drink. New Slogan: Become An Uber Eats Driver, Never Go Thirsty Again"
Good expirence food order
Hello I'm trying to apply for a delivery job with Uber eats can somebody help me on wat I have to do
"You don't want to deal with these thief. I had multiple occasion where they failed to deliver the food and still charged my credit card. Even worse, the courrier once ate my delivery and when I reclaimed the money with the help of my credit card compagny they charged me a second time! If you have do deal with any food delivery, don't chose such a dishonnest one."
Tentei usar o código 30fev válido até 28/02 na primeira vez e deu inválido. me fizeram passar fome!!!!!!?!
Fails to load sometimes- needs to be restarted. This has not affected orders to date.
Awesome it's very convenient for people especially when you have kids
Disappointed in the limited menu options and things saying sold out when they're not. No where to really report that info. Currently switching to door dash or other delivery services until uber steps up its game.
Great
No ability to contact customer support
Fast and hot good service
It really helpful especially when you're living alone and sick at home
"I go through all the stages of placing an order, but everyone i hit 'place order' it tries and eventually says 'app too busy', losing my order and making me start again from the beginning"
P good
Fast delivery and delicious food =p I would highly recommend anyone to use ubereats app.
"Pésimo , después de miles de Ordes hechas , llegan un repartidor no llama, no llega a la oficina correcta y cancela la orden y no hace devolución , sentido común TIENEN QUE LLAMAR SINO ENCUENTRAN LA OFICINA CORRECTA!! Pésimo !!"
Better then skip.
Good service
Was not pleased at all went back to using gurb hub.
Awesome experience! Saved the night for sure
It is so handy and has an excellent range of foods
I would not recommend Dont use this app they get your orders wrong and take your money they dont even help you if your order goes wrong and the drivers delivering it are extremely rude dont use this app use doordash or postmates instead this app is also extremely overpriced
I knew it was something I did not like about Uber eat I just couldn't find out what it was....the problem is don't say free delivery if you spend a certain amount but still charges for delivery.. it's like the free delivery is from the place we ordering from but not from Uber..steal Chargers the same amount for delivery what is the purpose telling us free delivery but it's not free... so when it don't say free delivery I guess y'all charging us for delivery twice
So much better than postmates. 1000% quicker and they actually deliver to my apartment and not click order delivered and never give me my food
Excellence delivery service. Great options
So far so great!
Never works. Always says try again later. Update- Have been back and forth with you all for 4 days! My account still doesn't work.
Prices are getting ridiculous
"Driver cancelled order after picking it up. Never received my order, can't rate him low or report him, and now the app is stuck on the Delivery Details page. No option for receiving credits as compensation and have to wait 3-8 days for refund."
"Faltam mais variedades de opções de pagamento, tipo Vales de Alimentação etc. YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE FREE DELIVERY AS WELL, AND MORE PAYMENT OPTIONS!"
Its pretty bad and very expensive and it says my email was used which I have never used before such a problamtic app to use
I really like this app
They fixed the bad parts that were causing trouble. 5 stars now!
"Uber eats charges delivery fees even when they say ""free delivery""."
friends food was eaten a
Cant log in on new phone
Great
Just love it. Service Fees can be a little pricey but overall love it
It keeps rejecting my photo id
You need to fix your tracking system. It doesn't tell me where my order is or where my driver is anymore. Then all of a sudden I get a notification to come outside. Extremely inconvenient.
This damn app won't even let me create an account to order for to be delivered.
I live in a nursing home and this gives me a lot of choices
"I hate uber Eats! I don't use it anymore because they never, NEVER get it right and iyer always arrives late and cold! It's also really weird how I just had to edit this review and im sure I didn't even review uber Eats yet and If I had I know i would never give a 5☆ review and that's what it had! it's making me wonder if they reviewed themselves using my profile?!? Save your $ and time and pick it up yourselves!"
Often items are damaged or missing. No delivery person has yet to read the delivery instructions. At least they are quick to refund but I really just want my food lol
Couldn't sign
"Your app will never be on my phone again, one of your delivery drivers actually called my job and harrassed me. WARNING TO ALL, UBER HIRES VIOLENT AND MENTALLY UNSTABLE PEOPLE, AVOID THEM. I'm sure this review isn't fair to the people that are mentally stable that work for your company but as the old saying goes "" it takes one bad one to ruin it for everyone """
taking off promos without notices
It's good but debit and credit card info could be better
Often have problems with ordering from Subway. And other restaurants.
Um lixo App quebrado. Me mandam SMS com codigo de desconto e nenhum funcionam. Vocês são uma piada. Empresa sem vergonha. Isso inclusive pode gerar processo por prejudicar o consumidor e propaganda enganosa.
FANTASEXICO!!!
Is Uber eats still available as an individual delivery app and not a part of zomato?
Fast friendly service brought to my door
"O aplicativo serve pra pedir comida, mas não manda notificação e nem aparece nos pedidos se seu pedido estava em análise do restaurante, ao contrário do Ifood, acabei pedindo outra comida por engano, gastando mais dinheiro, e o aplicativo nem tinha avisado se tinha ou não sido aprovado o outro pedido, agora fiquei com 2 pedidos em andamento. Não recomendo, usem outros aplicativos, talvez só serve por causa do Uber Rewards."
Good service
Cool
Works well but the specials should be at the top. Not sure why you guys remove them. Bring back limited time specials
This app allows me the daily dose of human interaction I require to function and keeps me alive through food.
"Restaurants seem to care less about quality and getting the order correct because it is UE. It would be really great if the order was checked in front of the carrier, before leaving for delivery. Food quality just seems low at times, special instructions ignored, and I'm missing one or more items often. UE is quick to refund for the items, but it can still ruin the meal - out of frustration or lack of food. With what is charged in fees, UE ought to do everything to insure the orders are correct."
O pior aplicativo de pedidos. Tudo não funciona perfeitamente e as promoções não funcionam.
In is excellent app
Nice
It's a faster way to order food
"Placed an order and an incorrect item was sent, uber refused to do anything about it. If this is how it works, i may as well just delete the app. I expect to get what i pay for, not what they decide to send me."
"Keeps saying ""something went wrong. Try again later"" and Helen from contact center hung up after 20 seconds."
Spotty with the food places but customer service is great
"Great app, easy, wish I could see what people say in ratings"
Worst support and customer service. Never use it again.
"It is wonderful to have the food delivered at your door, not only pizza or Chinese. My only thing is the total price with delivery and fees it adds up. No one wants to see a.40 dollars.meal turn into 70 dollars. Just a thought."
"For some reason, I'm unable to even use Uber Eats. When I click on the app it asks me to add a address, I type my address in and click ""search"", and then never goes to the next page. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I'm so frustrated."
"Awful. Had wrong food entirely delivered and couldn't get through to anyone for half an hour. The restaurant (McDonalds) said it's all entirely Ubers responsibility. When I finally got through to Uber, the customer service agent just read from a script and were completely awful. The number to call them was also almost impossible to find. Will never ever bother using again."
never works. I've updated. deleted and reinstalled.
Best thing ever !!! Fast and great service :)
Order delayed for 1 hour from time of delivery and the. Cancelled with a rude customer service member
Uber driver don't even try and do there jobs
Prompt delivery!
"Awful, unscrupulous company. They've been charging me $9.99 even tho I have no subscriptions to them. Fraudulent. Well, they can deal with my bank and without my further business. #helloLyft"
Delivery on good time and tasty food as well.
UNINSTALLED! My food is not here yet and it's been over an hour since my 'latest expected delivery' time. My driver diddnt move for over half an hour and I just had a small order of fast food. When I asked my driver if the food would be cold she told me I could microwave it. *UPDATE* food was marked delivered but was not delivered. Waiting on a pending refund. Customer service will not compensate me for my trouble in any way waited over two hours for nothing I was so hungry guys :(
"Useless app, I can't register on it"
Don't bother... Waste of time! I placed several orders... They all didn't go ahead. Will continue using justeat as I normally do. I went to the help section couldn't even find a help line number that I could contact to help. Lol seriously don't even waste your time. Placed 4 different orders... Then the app went back to home screen. What a joke!
Great service!
"Terrible! Use at your own risk!! 50% of our order was missing. If you complain then they tell you they will refund your "" bank account"" but in reality they refund your Uber Eats account and you can't do anything with those funds except apply it towards more shotty service from them. Afterwards they say I have a bill with them!! They make promises they do not keep. They don't respond to any follow up emails."
Never deliver my order and never take an action to resolve the issues
Easy to use
Love it!!
seems that I was charged multiple tines for one order
I really need it course I like food
"The worst service ever they want me to pay money for their mistakes I tried to contact them but they don't respond , I want to try this app because all of uber services are cool , my friend warned me that this app is horible and they were right now I cant use any of the other uber apps because they are telling me that I own them money"
Good app. But needs to have a place for notes on menu items
Food arrived piping hot.
I dont know whats wrong but i cant even get past delivery details.
Nunca aplicaron los descuentos ofrecidos.
Best app
No complaint
Not accepting my paypal or card payment this is recent fix this please
"I have had nothing but amazing experiences with UberEats, My food is delivered in the estimated time and my food is delivered still hot and fresh"
Não funciona!!!!
سئ جداااا لا يطبق كود الخصم و الغاء الاوردر صعب جدااا ..لازم انتظر لحد ما السائق يرد عليا و يقول انه تحت البيت ..و رسوم التوصيل مرتفعه لانها ثابته تكون المطعم خطوتين من البيت و التوصيل 15 ريال ..هنجر ستيشن احسن مليون مره
"NOTHING BUT AWESOME TRANSACTIONS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FIID DELIVERY COMPANY ON PRICE, TEMPERATURE OF FOOD. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! THANKS SO MUCH UBER EATS!"
Wont let me order
I well Order never late for us so I Think for my self the Better app was (Uber eat) Thanks to Read My Thought I well remember that it is a good time to get the ( Dish) So Download the App now😄😄👇👇👇👇Thanks God Bye...
"after delaying an order for 2 hours, they mark it as delivered to solve the problem. when you create a support ticket saying it's in fact not at all delivered, they give you your money back and mark the issue as resolved. no food in sight. very smart fellows."
Didn'ttoo Check my order
Bad experience
"Worst customer service in existence. Restaurants are randomly too far away for delivery and orders get canceled without reason. I live in NL, got a great promotion for free delivery in any UK city!"
Terrible service. Many times we wait for the food over the expected time and it gets cancelled. Three times it has happened that the order just gets cancelled after an hour and there is no way to cancel the order if this is taking to long.
Excellent
"Péssimo serviço, esperei 30 min o uber cancelou meu pedido!!!!!"
"I think this app is great at times but has its draw backs, sometimes it doesn't work but other times it's simple and easy to use. I have had faults with this app but nothing big enough to report."
Terrible how do you not have Mc Donalds on the app and I'm calling BS because there's like three near me & I have my location enabled. My Mc Donalds near me literally promotes Uber Eats inside the store. Here I am trying to use it and can't even pop up the right restaurants near me correctly. If you see some missing restaurants near you and know it's not on here go to Door Dash. How do you mess this up 🤦‍♂️
I have an error page in the app and it keeps me stuck on that screen unable to use any other app features so I sent a screenshot of the error page through email and Uber support Twitter and explained the issue and they just keep asking for the same information over and over again.Like an email asking me to send a screenshot of the error page that I already sent twice and when I tried calling over the phone I got transferred and told I should contact a completely different email.Unresolved still
best experience ever. they're fast with deliveries and food is always still hot
"Experience has been excellent, food is always great. I just wish there were more restaurant options."
"Most of the time it's great but the app does malfunction and I've been charged for stuff I've never ordered. Calling support line is sad because they don't care about the customer, bit for the most part the Uber eats is good"
عظييييم
Not getting food
"Cant even place orders because the $ off promotion offered cant be used at the restaurant location for the order (how do you have an active promotion and when you try to check out you say it cant be used?), with no way to remove it. I could care 2 s**ts about the discount, let me take the promotion off and place the order normally. Just signed up for the service and cant even use it. Waste of time."
Think mc dons should do order when they arrive as sometimes it comes warm only just only 5 min walk should be hot
"If you enter a support ticket, it'll be routed to the drive team. If their system screws up, you still get charged. They can't keep their software working and are condescending when you contact them. Stick to Postmates."
It wont even let me put my number in it say something went wring try again
"Worst customer service I have ever felt with!! Always later, soggy, and cold. Ontop of being way over priced."
Very buggy and overpriced.
Horrible entire order was incorrect and all the offered was to comp the drinks which i never got and gave me a 5 dollar credit the bil was over 50$
"Best app for ordering food fast, reliable and able to track food from the takeaway to the door depending on scran place 💯💯💯"
Absolutely amazing!
"Excellent as always, great way to eat out"
I have downloaded this app before and wasn't happy with it I thought I would try it again but now it will not even let me place an order because my email is already registered with an ubereats account it will not let me log in with the app I can't send you a message from in the app it won't let me log into it
"App is easy to use once setup, but some restaurants aren't in it."
Customer service is terrible at best. These guys are taxis not food partners! Order #C604F was the order number.
Wont take my payment. Was close to Diamond rewards but couldn't even use my card since January.
No apology for poor service or lost food.
I cannot order because it says I should verify my account but it doesn't show options where I can verify
"Bag of w*nk, why is McDonald's refusing orders the one time I want to use this pos."
Service fee goes up the more pricey the food and I hear the driver doesn't see a dime for service fee
"Publicidad engañosa! Hacen promociones y luego no te dejan añadir el código. Una vez nunca me llegó la comida. Servicio al cliente es pésimo, que difícil es ponerse en contacto con alguien para que de respuestas. Ya desinstalé el app"
Wonderful experience with the great service ever
The quality of the delivery is excellent and the delivery charge is so affordable....
"I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 1. As a long-time user, I'm honestly shocked by the poor ""help"" support experience I received today. Response to Uber Eats' reply: If the message telling me that my issue had been ""resolved"" over an hour after the initial diagnosis chat-bot type message was received (with no interim updates on whether the food was still to arrive), and still not having the refund reflecting today qualifies as having the issue addressed, then yes the issue is closed."
Your app keeps saying that the place is unavailable and I cannot order there when it's open and I'm within radius for delivery this has been happening for ages please can you fix this issue
Tretick took 35 minutes to deliver 1.3 Miles
"I honestly love this app so much. Thank you Uber. Much better than all of the other food delivery apps/services. The subscription for $10 a month is actually worth it if you use the app a lot!! I order food with this app at least once every 2 days. My job is strict about leaving to go on a break, so I simply order lunch with Uber Eats. It's honestly perfect and the drivers are always really well trained in a way. Always courteous and on time."
The worst delivery company ever. Due to wrong location Services. They delivered my food in Texas. I couldn't even cancel within a minute. Never again!!
Dude who brought me food was late and rude. Ignored the meet at car request. Also way too expensive 🤷‍♀️
👍👍
Quick and easy
Muy buena aplicación. Si estás ajorado es un buen resuelve.
A lot better then Just Eat because they actually deliver to the right house
simple and quick
I couldn't place my order I don't understand why. I need to place an order.
I love it Uber is a big help when I don't feel like cooking or going out to pick it up
"Uber eats is just going down, 3 of my last orders were missing something I paid for, and at first they would let me submit a complaint. But the last order mix up, the app would not let me submit my complaint about my missing food, that the restaurant did not give me. Either the driver's need to make sure they have all my food and the restaurant need to do their job and pack my food accurately. I'm disappointed."
Really convenient Great promos Keep up the good work 👍💯
So bad of their services
Love it yo. Great for at work or lazy days!
Friendly approachable punctual
Great soo far.
4 out of 5 times food makes it on time
"Why put the tip part after total for the order on a separate screen, BTW that is why this 1 star."
You sold the app why the hell you are keeping it for
Uber eats does not understand that food is an experience. They regularly get your order wrong deliver the wrong items and ruin your evening. I wouldn't even trust them to deliver the right medicine let alone food. Incompetence of the highest order.
Worst app
"I AM DONE WITH UBEREATS. First of all I ordered three different times from the same restaurant and each time they forgot my fries, I even have the photos yet I still haven't gotten a refund. Secondly, Ubereats charged me twice $11.65 when I only had ordered once that day, yet they make it so difficult to receive any help because there is no service number to call, and when I sent an email (this is the exact email I use so I get my receipt and promotions) only response I got was of no help."
Works well overall and haven't had any issues with meals
Good
Great
"No longer accepting any form of payment, not even cash!"
I can't order because it's not in my area and I can't even browse the restaurants .
This app is too bad And sri lankan costermer care is too bad Card payment are not allowed Dont download this app I called to custermer care but they not solve my problem They don t understand this app They get my time about 20 minutes but they couldn t sole my problem
Uber eats is no more ....... Company colabs with zomato so waste of time dont download this app never..... ever ..... RIP....
"Driver stole half my order. Stay away and use deliveroo Edit: I requested a full refund but was refunded only the items that were missing. Nothing for the delivery and no credit was given. What was the point of me using this app to order food for two, and not being able to even enjoy it? Not to mention the enormous amount of stress and anger this caused. This happens way too often with Uber Eats. There is no help phone line to even tackle these issues. Garbage service"
automatically purchases without my permission
Nice
"Horrible app, if you are new and number already registered then it will take time like our politician taking for development .pani pe ke so jana.worst food app"
false app worst experience
Wish the gps was easier to use and menus won't just a list of text. Feels like I have to search more for what want.
Too expensive compared to other delivering apps
Very very bad
"Why show restaurants that after you select them are ""too far too deliver""?! The app already knows my location. Ridiculous. Also why show so many restaurants that are ""Currently unavailable""? So annoying!"
Why and how have you been taken over by Zomato???
"Is this still working everyone I tried opening the app got the message ""taken over by zomato"""
It has good promotion
Excellent.
Very bad app
"Won't even let me log in, having the same issues others have reported-the app is making me sigh up but I've alresdy signed up I want to sign in. No option to sign in. No doubt I'll get a copy paste response that everyone does but it seems pointless. Use Deliveroo instead"
McDonalds always arrives cold but others ok
Very convenient
You guys should not have merged with zomato the delivery charge is 50-60 rupees for even a 90 rupees food unbelievable .hate the app both zomato and uber eats you guys were phenomenal the service was topnotch when you guys were an individual .
Great service...fast delivery within 15 mins..
"The app completely does not work for me now. Its been stuck on a page asking for a new delivery address. But after typing one in it doesn't do anything. It doesn't load, change pages, or even let me see food options in the area. It won't let me navigate away from that one page for literally anything."
Lack of any type of support but good app for food delivery.
Very convenient
Morning coffee to my door. What isn't to love!
Simple and easy to use
No cash on delivery option were available at moment and made dis comfort
Its amazing
Good service
It does not to accept my orders. I hate this app
"Troubles with ordering a food. I order 2 times the same food in the same time. Ad I didn't know it, because it doesn't show that you order 2 food"
Better than other food delivery. Faster and the app is way easier to navigate. Searching within a menu is awesome.
Awesome
I like it 👍
"It doesn't pick up the nearest shops for my food deliveries ,,,,,, and it made me wait 45 minutes,"
This app z awesome. Food z delivered hot and fast
very good
Im really not happy with Uber eats. I've ordered from them no more than 3 times and suddenly the app is telling me I'm too far from the location when they're literally 5 minutes up the road by car. I cannot understand how I'm able to order one minute and not the next? Absolutely rubbish!
"Does not let me add anything at all to basket, just keeps on bleeting am to far away, yet my mate can order anything from same location as me!"
Coollll...
It had nothing literally nothing. Wasted time
Support responds to problems relatively fast
Nice
"broken app, have to log in with phone number but can only add phone number to account after logging in, great logic and design, im completely locked out of my 9.99 eats pass dont recommend if you have any other service in your area use them, customer service has been hard to contact and subsequently useless"
Good service but tax policy is kinda irritating
Cool
not good
"App is fine, But It does not allow me to enter my other number, says Your account does not have a password . (One sim is working and the other sim is not working. tried many times)."
Good
"My first uber account was tied to a phone number I no longer have access to or use. I still have access to the email of that account, however the phone associated with it is old. This apparently makes the account unable to access. Meanwhile im still receiving consistent emails of my account specific discounts that I cannot even use. I've made other accounts since then but I only recieve discounts on that account. Beyond frustrating."
When i enter my number it says ur account does not have a password..whats that means fix it plz i cant log
"Could see rider on the app. He went about 100m from the restaurant, called us and said the address was wrong then refused to answer his phone. Got a refund from Uber Eats but this has put me off their service for good."
Always on time for deliveries and the delivery guys are über friendly too.
Good
"Most probably the easiest and efficient reliable food delivery app to use in the middle east! Great deals , quick deliveries."
"LOOK OUT FOR SNEAKY CHARGES EVEN IF DELIVERY IF FREE.... !! Restaurants often make mistakes, what you Order & what you get is Hit & Miss. Uber Customers Service is appalling, an absolute mockery. No one truly speaks English or understands English to be more precise. You are always told to go to the ""Get Help"" section on the App which is a contradiction of Terms & has no area of Resolution nine out of ten times. I recommend you use a Competitive Delivery Services, avoid Uber if possible"
"The worst of experience!while ordering they wouldn't let me checkout and say network error but magically ends up that i ""placed"" my order and comes to my doorstep.oh please get your network glitches fixed!"
"Bad services!! I tried to report an unrecognized charge to my account, but there has been no reply. The support landline is unreachable, and the app won't send my Uber Eats data to my email"
Exactly what I ordered on time promised.
"My delivery was delayed for two hours and then canceled, when I complained they said they were sorry and told me to make a new order. Not likely"
Why all the fees and them you clearly up charge on the food. I understand some of the fees but this is just greedy. I hate uber eats. Your truly a greedy co. Trust me when i say you will not be around for the long haul do to your GREED
"Horrible customer service, they charged me for an order that was canceled before a driver as even assigned to it. They said it was because the place had already started preparing but I called the place, McDonalds. And they don't start prepping until the driver is 3 minutes away so since there was no driver there should have been no charge at all. This coming 3 days off of a driver making me feel unsafe. Uber don't care, even after reaching out to customer support there has been no reply yet."
I have ordered multiple timed off the app and almost every single time there has been an issue. Either the driver does not bring change or it takes two and a half to three hours to get to me or the delivery partners are rude or its the wrong order. Today I was charged more than I should have been and then they credited me the difference on the account which does not help and it does not really solve the issue of the driver being rude and not able to assist with the issue.
"Lovely polite driver,thankyou."
Good
"I was a big fan of uber eats, particularly when there were issues, the service would remedy any mistakes, until my last order. It seemed as though the driver ate half my food. I submitted a complaint to uber but this time the company seemed uninterested to remedy the error. I was told they welcomed my feedback and would look into it. I followed up for some form of remedy, a discount off the next order maybe? Sadly not. Update February 2020 Missing items from order. Poor service from uber eats"
"Would be nice to see reviews of the food, so I know what I'm going to get. Also certain delivery riders think it's rude if you don't come to them? Finally.. the support, suggestions and problem review system is an complete joke! I had my last account banned because I reported a delivery of MacDonald's when I ordered Chinese food. UberEats is basically carrying a snickers bar trying to climb Mt. Everest."
Uber eats service stopped in India
Only good when it works but most if the time it says the unavalible
Very very bad service
After registration it tells that it has veeen acquired by zomato and asks us to order from zomato that means again we have to install zomato again
"My experience with the app has been great so far. Quick, efficient, bigger choice of restaurants than other apps can offer, and whenever there are any issues with the delivery, the refund has been immediate. I also like the option to tip the driver after the delivery (some other apps offer to tip the driver before the food gets delivered - why would I ever do that)"
If your order is delivered wrong. Good luck getting your money back.
This app sucks its just stole from me $47.30 not knowing how if i never used it and it says i just bought something if i didn't had the app
Low price when compare to swiggy and zomato. We need Uber eats back. Bcoz convinent charge and delivery charge is lower than swiggy and zomato. NIGHT SHIFT employes and low salary peoples are getting more benefit in this Ubereats. We need Ubereats back in India To teach lesson to zomato and swiggy. We are very disappointed when heard about zomato got Ubereats.
very good and convience
It wil not allow me order my food it is sayin currently unavailable even though I have rang the restaurant and they are tellin me it is up and running in there side that I should be able to order this has happened serval times now
Driver cancelled without coming to the door. Too lazy to even walk up a set of stairs.
"Love Uber Eats, when you at work and need a bite it's super convenient"
Thanks for your help
"Horrendous - the app allows the delivery partner to add a comment about an issue, but the customer cannot comment in response. This is very frustrating when the delivery partner tells a lie."
Not worth my time just like the rest the screw the drivers and only care if they make money
My only problem is that it doesn't allow me to use my card for payments.
App was convenient but support service experience is worth one star.
Super
WONDERFUL APP.
Wonderful
Yeah this is insanely bad now. I can't even order anything.
Good service
Big mac was cold and ordered 2 milkshakes got no straws 🙄
They offer no support for incorrect orders if you've complained more than once
Horrible
Just the best :)
"Mostly good but constantly crashes on promo input. Doesnt feature entire menus of restaurants on app. Customer service has become useless, unless you like a hearty gfy."
"The worst app i ever download, shame on you"
Ok
Jab zomato ne tughe kharid liya h to tera app play store pay jhak maraane k liye rakaha h
Good 👍
Very handy
"I love the options they give but the app suddenly stops working at a moments notice making me start over again with my order, usually 2 to 4 times per order. I will still use the app because I like the options."
Easy
"yum yum food is good 10/10 ""- stoner reports: good for food when really hungry."""
EDIT: They fixed it really quickly :) Put my number in and it doesn't send me a text message. Tried a few times /:
Takes a little longer than an Uber ride. But I like the food delivery service and hot food on call .
"Basura, hice un pedido y lo pagué con tarjeta al final nadie recogió mi pedido, no me devolvieron el dinero y cancelaron la orden sin preguntar No descarguen este robo, he escuchado ya varias personas que me dicen lo mismo y está muy mal"
Why did the uber company sold eats to zomato?my biggest concern If its not working then it should be removed from play store
Stop bugging me for reviews
"Very disappointed. Ordered my food and never received my order. Driver never, not even once contacted me about my order. Not sure I'd use them again. They deserve 0 stars."
Whatever you are looking for is here.
Why don't you ask to reconfirm the delivery address? It's creating huge trouble every time.
"When i start the app it says ""enter new address""....can't move past that screen"
Quick
"Horrible!!! 10 min to be delivered they cancel on me, without no reason whatsoever efff them I'll wait until tomorrow, I get it myself!!!."
On average very efficient
Always get the wrong order and they take to long to respond to your messages to fix the problem
"Super convenient, best food app."
Can't deliver to my workplace
Every order is great but missed a drink on my last order. Very disappointed
Easy when I'm not home to cook.
It's getting more expensive but it's still the best of the food delivery apps
Cool
Pésimo servicio
Amazing
"Easy to use, love the options"
Poifect
Easy to use and safe
"I enjoy using this app for easy food delivery, but I don't understand why the service fee is necessary and if you have to order $15 worth of food just avoid the ""small order fee"". Also, it would be nice to have a notification like a text message when the food is on the way or has arrived. Sometimes I'll order my food and then get busy doing something and forget to check the tracking on the app. By the time I remember to check, my delivery person has arrived and I have to rush to go get my food."
Gift card wouldn't apply
"The app has slightly improved in the past few years, and decently stable. But it tells me that I can update the tip within one hour of ordering, but any change to the tip does not take effect. If anyone from Uber is reading this, let me know if this bug has been fixed, or more details are desired. Edit: Issue still exists with tipping, where updated amounts do not take effect. I am amazed that Uber has a bug with handling money still. Users of this app should not have to clear the app cache."
Worse app ever!!!!!! My address doesn't pop up and not working properly
They don't clarify where do you want to send your food to. It should be more clear in the UX. I keep accidentally send it to my home. Hope they improve the UI UX
Yummy!
Poca seriedad con los clientes. No responden los problemas ni quejas. Cero servicio al cliente
It freezes constantly
Use Grub Hub. Their drivers have an option to pick up multiple orders. Which has caused the driver to drive across town then back to me(im in the route their going) very dissatisfied with the way their system works.
"I had soo many items missing from my order, sent message to complain to support. Response after 7 hours saying they are unable to help me. Really bad experience, will never use uber ears or uber, stay away from fraud company!!!!!"
"My food was terrible, when I complained, I was issued a $5 credit. The restaurant told me to contact Uber which I did twice. I guess I won't be using uber eats again."
Nice when the right ppl do there job
Frustrating tried to rate purchase and it would not let me !
"Tried to order McDonald's down the street not even 5 minutes and it told me I was out if the delivery area! No instructions on how to fix it was available, finally went to McDonald's website and got the right app to get it delivered, so lame!"
Sucks. Bait n switch free delivery. Hidden fees. Don't use
Best app ever
"I love this app, Especially when I don't feel like cooking"
Easy to use.
Por lo general es un buen servicio!
Great Food and Speedy service
Good
I like FOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
I just wanna get some warm food when I order it not this cold food and tasteless .
"Great app, especially when traveling!!!"
Very quick
Good app that offers great places
Wonderful service
"Excellent, very easy to use and the delivery was perfect and quick"
Great
food to your door
Wish there were more combinations of ways to sort and filter but overall great app
Worst and Worst every update. Can't see the cars on the map to know when they are coming with my food. Y'all need to do something if you want me again. I'm done
Not as user friendly as could be
Sucks ass
"Will not let me place order. Claims phone number is not verified. I checked and my phone number is on fact verified. What gives Uber. Update, went to your help website, just like in the app, there's no option to actually talk to anyone, and the options given don't apply at all to the issue I'm having. This is garbage, fix it. If i could give less than one star I would."
My Experience with UberEats is buying food that expensive to get one meal! Do not buy from Steak n' shake it's very cold greased out lunch.
I can't find a special instructions area when ordering food
I need more coupons so I can order more.
Stupid app doesn't even work. Won't let me search an address. Removing this app.
"Navegação bastante poluída por propagandas. App cheio de bugs (não reconhece o endereço cadastrado, apresenta falhas durante a escolha do pedido, etc). Vivem enviando cupons inválidos (mesmo que tente utilizar no mesmo dia que foi enviado, a única resposta do suporte é ""confira a validade"". Se você diz que já conferiu, ignoram a mensagem)"
App always works. Food selections excellent
Keep getting a server error upon checkout. Can't place any orders. Been using this app for over 2 or 3 years and it was convenient when it functioned.
I'm going to uninstall this app 😬🤨
Cant customize most of your stuff and now all of a sudden you cant pick your drink for your meal -.-
Haven't failed so far
I have always enjoyed my deliveries. Great restaurants and great drivers.
Love it
This is very easy to use and cheaper than other delivery services.
"It's fine, I can't blame the app itself if the people who pick up the food don't follow the directions on the screen. But hey, you guys are doing great, keep up the good work!"
Fantastic
Way to expensive. To many fees.
"The maps portion of the app is absolutely abysmal over the last 2 weeks. Driver routes don't update, time estimates are broken, and final destinations have made order pickups a hassle. No fault of the drivers, but the app is broken and getting worse."
More than an hour for food to be delivered in a near by location. Bad GPS tracking and ETA.
"1 star for the frustration, cant just have a normal sign in option? I got a new phone and now cant use the app and it just tells me my email address is already registered and now the app is unusable unless i make a new email i guess.."
Buena app. Bastante amigable de usar y con opciones variadas de comida.
Adding new credit cards and removing expired ones is a nightmare. No put any thoughts on this.
Very kind staff and fast love it so much
Better thab Grubhub. It gives you a serious idea of where your food is every step of the way and you can rush your order if you choose.
I love this!
Terrible went round and round when trying to log in and was using my credentials and it still did not letme in. Had to go thru help whichis useless. Applied a gift card and it did not apply the gift card just took all the moneyfrom my debit account. Tried to find a way to change thisand there is no way to reacha customer service rep. Ubereats not impressed.
So far so good. Orders are delivered on time and as described.
Worst online ordering app ever
Great experience
Never an issue. Use often
Good
Awesome.
"Pésimo servicio. La plataforma no es fácil de usar, es difícil indicar la ubicación exacta y no es posible evaluar a los socios repartidores."
customer support is more of less unheard of. if you have a problem with your order you're on your own
I ordered crab legs and shrimp but got a freaking pizza and bread...smh. Zero quality control and zero attention to detail...two things required to be successful in this line of work. I'm pissed...I wanted crab legs!!!
"The app is still loaded with bug and difficult to use. Customer service is non-existent, just automated responses."
Worked great until I had recieved a email about someone trying to change my password so I went ahead and reset it any now when I hop on it doesn't let me input my address. It stays on the page input new delivery address. Wont let me search or anything. S10 plus
The best
Stupid company charged me for my order but didnt want to order and deliver the right thing from pizza hut.
I don't like uber eats . They take money in a sec and if you change your mind in 3 second your money is gone
Great@
nice
Can't even find starbucks on the app
"The app is excellent. The only problem is that if you have 2 phones, it often won't recognise you, if your main phone battery is dead. But the service and support are of the highest quality."
"No me dejaba pasar. Puse bien mi numeo, recibia el codigo, puse bien el codigo y aun asi no podia avanzar."
Multiple delivery failures. Customer service is damned near impossible to reach and are very slow to respond to issues. Menus are incomplete and significantly more expensive than the normal prices. The app will lie about delivery times when there won't be any delivery.
I have yet to get a my order correctly delivered. Always missing items and when I tell the driver they always direct me back to the app and to take it on with you! And I have yet to get a response from anyone at UberEATS 😠!!!
Uber eats do not respect or believe they're customers. They only care about the business owners. I haven't asked for a refund but I'd like to get what I paid for since you take my money first. I spend hundreds of pounds through the app and yet they don't care what I have to say. Deleting uber and uber eats. If you have the same issue you're better off with Justeat.
"Ordered McDonald's last time, cost me about 14.00 for the food with delivery and the food was cold. Big Mac and fries food was cold, never again. Fast food ain't really fast on a penny farthing. #mcCold #mountainbike, maybe if the link worked I could send a message #ubereats-avoid You said contact us on the link, this was the reply Sorry, we couldn’t find that page"
No support when simple things go wrong.
Have no problem
Can't sign in
"Terrible service. Placed an order - order was picked up by driver but about 5-7 minutes later was cancelled. Called restaurant who confirm that the driver had picked up order. No option to contact the driver. Driver did not even bother to call me to update me. Called UberEats customer service - just told me that I will get a full refund. This is appalling service. You make someone place an order, make them wait passed delivery time and then say it's cancelled. With no offer of resolving this!!!"
I'm loving it
Precisa melhorar o preço.
"Generally no issues, food always comes quickly and they dealt with the one complaint I had very quickly"
Keeps showing error after error. Really bad user experience. Go back to the drawing board.
Each time I have used uber eats excellent service
"Customer service is terrible if something goes wrong, you can't speak to them over the phone, it is reserved for restaurants only, not customers. They basically told me to go away! All call centres are located in India too, exploiting people abroad. Shame on them"
Normally works well. If you order food and there's no driver available it will not tell you until you've been charged for the meal and there is no refund.
I don't like being forced to tip prior to service. I don't care whether or not I can change it afterwards in the app. Ridiculous!
Pior aplicativo que já baixei na vida
"I just order my food and am waiting for that suddenly they show delivered, but I didn't receive any item they send me email and I see there he delivered on wrong address"
Kfc got my whole order wrong the food was freezing cold .none of our meals was the write thing we ordered ....
Have problem ordering from some McDonald's restruants
It's significantly more lit than Rappi and it just yeets eats to your front door
Absolute complete shiet never any available always down order randomly say to far from store that is less than a mile away
"The Uber Eat app is a complete mess, customer service is in India or Pakistan and I could not understand the representative. My issue was not resolved nor was it understood by customer service, they could give less of a care about the issue. I will not be ordering ANYTHING from Uber Eats in the future and will advise anyone not to either. Customer service representatives should understand the language not just pass out refunds, a computer could have done that with more feelings than they did."
"For some ungodly reason I decided to try this again and they just said they delivered my food, but nothing was delivered, save your money, use Postmates"
"I get drivers need to be paid/tipped - but it's a rip off to base service fee on $ of order. It's ridiculous that 'service fee' based on $ of order. Should not cost more to deliver a sandwich vs burger because 1 is more expensive. Also the eats pass subscription... It says pass is only good for orders in Wichita, but I live in and have only ordered from Hutch - Wichita is an hour away - why is the pass not good where I live and order from?"
Trash app i would give it zero stars but it wont let me
Terrible support. Very difficult . Useless not happy.
Bad
Frequent mistakes no real help from Uber Eats
"Awful app, awful company. Randomly cancels orders after waiting in for delivery for hours. Removes promotions without warning and for no reason. Absolute shambles."
"The fact that my meal was 13.70 and by the end of all their fees being added not including a tip it came to 30.00, no thanks! I'll go to another delivery service."
Delivery drivers taken my order a hour and a half ago and dropped to 4 other people in a different mcdonalds and my orders just sitting saying hes picking it up and hes just going somewhere else again owens apparently on a bicyle bs what a joke
Worst app in yhe world i have 50$ in credits and i cant even use them
Customer service purposely takes forever so that the order goes through and then when your trying to cancel it you still get charged
Great app but wish more could be done about restaurants that mess up food though besides reporting it as nothing seems to come of it. (Recieved some very burnt food that should not have been packaged for delivery)
I've made an accidental purchase and the app isn't working properly. I'm stuck on the delivery page and I can't cancel my order.
"Food not delivered, support impossible to get in touch with"
So far so good. I have no complaints
no usa gps y manda mis pedidos lejos. siempre llegan frias.
"Very poor services,i did not like how my ice cream was delivered"
Не смог подключиться. Да и хрен с ним.
Super easy to use and LOVE how you can message the courier directly!
Very easy
You can only order 1 item at a time...😕
Bad
"Serviço lixo, atendimento lixo, não tem opção de falar com o entregador, serviço de ajuda péssimo, onde vc tem q ligar e a solução é o cancelamento depois de esperar por mais de 1hora pelo pedido sendo q o restaurante não atende o suporte e o entregador está do outro lado da cidade e não atende o próprio suporte. Uber está em total declínio em todos os serviços e não tem preocupação nenhuma em melhorar. Só ganhou 1 estrela pq não tem como deixar o comentário sem. Fuja do UberEats."
Very good
"First order, driver went to wrong street so he called and we gave him directions, he drove passed our street then cancelled the order we had waited for, including our two year old. Now having to resort to Plan B with a hungry little boy. Will promptly be deleting the app and not using it again"
App perrooona
"Customer service was disgusting. Food was late and cold. Had a nightmare of a time trying to get through to customer service to rectify the situation, only to be told when we did get through that ""it wasn't there problem"" and refused us a refund. I would give this app a 0 rating if possible."
I couldnt even use the app because it says ny email was already regestired but i never even used the app before
Amazing
ابلكيشن زي الخره وشكله من جوه كئيب واستخدامه صعب ورخم همسحه خالص

Yes I love it
This is such a fast and easier way to order
"Be prepared to pay a LOT of extra fees for very little, you'll also end up missing stuff from your order multiple times. The costumer service is poor, just passing any issues around and replying with copy/pasted replies. This was a good app but has gone way down hill, I use to be a ""Platinum Member"" witch means nothing to them. If you can just pick up the food yourself and skip the middle man. Jeffrey from Uber Eats costumer service refused to resolve my issues so I've deleted Uber all together."
Exceptional service!
Would be great but there are no hours when restaurants are open or delivery is available. Also restaurant can after 20 minutes cancel your order without reason and you able to review it. Additionally I've lost discount coupon for this order.
Very nice app for eatin
Good
While opening uber eats app to book Oder its telling me to go and book Zomato thn why i want to install and update uber eats. I just go with swiggy only.
Não ganho cupons de desconto há muito tempo.
"Unable to check out due to an error, customer support is a joke, not helpful at all. Ended up going with Postmates."
Always late arrival. Better to drive yourself and get it.
Best ever!!
Love this app! So far I've only had great experiences with the drivers and my food has always been good
"A shrill soulless platform that cares not for it's users, you disgust me with how many times I have been wronged only to be met with a complete lack of owness and empathy."
Great
"Always been a really positive experience. People who deliver the food have been really friendly everytime, and food always arrives at a good quality."
Very Good so far
Good one
its pretty good
"Works as advertised until it doesn't. Not a bad service, just not good either. Good luck getting a real person on the phone with Ubereats themselves without googling a bit to find an actual number. Their in-app ""help"" section offers no way to get in touch with any actual person via text or phone, at all. Fool me once, fool me eight times, I'm the chump I guess."
Unable to login.... My number
"The app has technical difficulties. I pressed the back key and it ordered. The cart said not empty. The help section does not match the options in the app. After closing and re opening twice, the cart moved to order processed. I dug around the app to press cancel. I was charged after canceling. Press order not arrived for a phone number. Explained twice that I hit the back button. Full refund given. I'm uninstalling the app!"
worst app can't login very bad worst ever made no login page how do you survive
Excellant
"yea doe , this wack ole app not trying to let me sign up or anything .. and it's funky because I'm trynna Uber me some food , but it ain't letting me sign up , this a whole 1 star needed not even that this a no star app and I hate it ."
This app should have a cancel option within 60 second.
My order was incorrect and the driver was lost...
Sent food to the wrong address; I messaged and told I wasn't eligible for a refund... I asked for the food to be resent and was ignored... Would rate 0 stars if possible
Absolutely rubbish...keep on getting the message I opt out of receiving text and when I try to text start on number to opt back in it never gets sent you can't even speak to operators because your number not associated with account ...just ridiculous
Love it
2 of the 3 orders I made had a missing or incorrect item. A complete joke
Great
Have had nothing but such good experinces with uber eats.
Nice app
Uber eat convert to Zomato
Very reliable.
Exceptional
I don't know who designed this app i can't set location on map and if I type address it doesn't show. This type apps should be user friendly. Look at other delivery service apps like zomato and swiggy. 😡😡😡😡
It gives error that the store is too far from your location to 200 metres away restaurants. After that error you can not clear your basket. There is no button for it. There is no easy way to chat and get information... Worst ordering app ive ever seen.
Rider says card payment and instructions came not to collect money. After few minutes he again came saying that money not came. So I paid cash. I have to wait to check this on week day working hours.
Love it...im a trucker and get stuck places woth no food. It helps alot.
Great app useful
Simply amazing
Great
So much better than door dash!
Nice
No complaints! Great app
"wie die app download sal nooit spuit wees van ek geniet dit om elkedag te ordering enige its,dit spaar minder moeite en bespaar geld,hiers free kosse as j 1 bestel en kry 1 free by vir dieselle prys,danki uber eats u rock my world"
One of the best delivery apps I have used
"It has a wealth of options, but it doesn't tell you if your address is outwith delivery range until after you have already created your order. Near enough all of my 'Popular Near You' restaurants don't deliver to me, so why would they promote places I can't order from? It does nothing but drive me elsewhere. Unintuitive and should really be looked into."
Prices are higher than normal plus charging for delivery and other add on fees. This is robbery. Makes it less appealing.
Great
Order fot ordered even though i haven't went to checkout. No cancel order button
"Good offers are here! IT IS USER FRIENDLY AND TASTY 🤗 FOR A HOSTELIte LIKE ME. MANY ITEMS ARE SOLD OUT QUICKLY , PLS GIVE US MORE NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT FOOD AND INCLUDE MORE RESTAURANTS"
تطبيق سئ جدا فمنذ أن انزلته و اوبر الآخر يعطى رسائل غير مفهومه اطلب سياره يعطي payment method not availabe و عندما اطلب أطعمة و احددها و يرسل لى رساله بأن لى خصم يعطى أيضا رساله لا تعنى أي شئ و عند الشكوى لخدمة العملاء الخاصه باوبر لم يتم عمل اى شئ و لم أطلب لا طعام و لا سياره من تليفوني نهائيا بل اطلب من احدهم أن يطلب لى من تليفونه و الآن اركب تاكسي عادى أو اطلب محل الطعام أفضل و اريح
nice job
Crashing on payment. Waste of time
Its good
Poor support
Great!!!!
This is very easy for use
I have.a big mc & strawberry milkshake missing
Great app
This was a great app but now uber eats is sold to zomato which has frustratingly worst services. Miss the old uber eats.
"It's a bit too pricy for me, takes ages and whenever I order McDonald's it's always squished and cold. I'd say the main pro is being able to track them on the map"
I had an issue with my order and when I tried to contact ubereats I was told nothing could be done because 'the order was placed 10 days ago'. I ordered it today so that's incorrect and now no one will answer me. Awful customer service - DO NOT USE!.
THANKS FOR UBER
I like Uber Eats but if you don't use it often and would like to take advantage of the free delivery you have to rush through your order. If there's something you can't find you have to look for it but then lose out on the free delivery.
"I don't want some guy on bicycle delivering, takes too long & food cold, give us option to select delivery type, might as well go by bus to pick up. Need to show more restaurant details, location etc some have more than 1 branch within delivery area or similar names so can't confirm which restaurant ordering from. Ends up coming from other side of borough instead of local."
Keeps getting worse: service and delivery times
👍
Still waiting and it says delivered
"o massa é que voces dao cupom de desconto pra fazer a gente baixar o aplicativo, e na hora finalizar o pedido da erro."
Grrrrreat
Great
As quick as bullet i never expected that quick. Keep it up....
Good...
Would be good if they offered delivery in my area... Im on the outskirts of a city and still no available delivery options for any Macdonalds as they advertised... Guess I gotta wait now....
Super
I loved this app but since the Zomato bought it I have This app
"Very bad ,food is missing"
Better to add more photos of dishes
It is better if you could enter address by selecting on map
"Only ordered twice and both orders had mistakes, went back to postmates"
Why this app is not working
Phone nmbr dile xcept kore. Faltu. Your number does nor have a password. Xcept na korle password dibo kivabe?? Ajib akta app
Gr8
Delivery fees are ridiculous
I can't register nw because they said my account doesn't have a password.should I first download an ubber app and then ubber eats?
The food come fast
"The App idea seems amazing, however it doesn't support my location."
Slow and order wasn't right. Also a hair in food. It was black. Mines long an blonde.
👍🏽
Arrived at the latest possible time and was cold
Sometimes it takes several hours but when its on time itts alright and convenient
"It's excellent, that's all there is to say about it"
"App works ok, but customer service is rubbish. Reported to them that McDonald's has missed items off my order and it ends up with Uber threatening to deactivate my account intimating that I am trying to commit fraud! Wouldn't even confirm that they will speak to the restaurant to raise the issue."
"Absolutely useless app. Worked once the error,error,error"
Fantastic
"I just hate this app,,,so frustrated"
Can't switch language. Address selection is atrocious.
Awesome
"Good app with a variety of good options. The delivery drivers lack basic training though. Far too often I find something missing from my order and, when I ask where it is, I am met with a blank stare followed by, ""they didn't give me that."" Surely the driver knows what he's meant to be collecting and should check the order before leaving the store?"
It's ok
Good
Best
Never ask for confirmation of order Fake offers
Good
The worst company ever. I had promotional voucher added to my account. Uber removed £10 voucher without a reason.
"Disgusting quality food, always soggy and late and cold. Horrible."
Rip uber eats
Great app
Doesn't work properly half the time
Order food had to wait an hour which is cool all for them to tell me after the hour that a driver cant be found....and i paid for the uber pass fpr no reason bascially. And still hungry and every restuarant is closed!!!!😔
What a joke I was charged for a meal that never got confirmed never came and apparently I get a refund in 10 days or more... When your really hungry you really should try another service as this is not a reliable source as I spent 20mins trying to place the order as they wouldn't confirm but quick to take my money.. 😮😮😮😮😮😮🙄🙄🙄🙄😮😮😮😮😮
Ek no. Ka gnda app
WORST APP EVER
Please try to add more specific information and image of food. Also make the peoples review visible
Good service
Great! My order arrived on time!
Easy. Simple. Time saved for stuffing gob
Im broke and fat. Thanks
Best app ever
Cannot place order from two restaurants at the same time gives error on payment not verified!
"Worst customer service. Placed several orders, could never find a delivery driver or get my food. Still had to pay. I'll never use uber for ride or delivery services"
Great stuff
Wonderful
"Can we please get a payment option during delivery, cause sometimes i swap to cash cause am having it in my hands and forget to change it and only realize when the order went through that am not getting a bank notification, just that flexibility to change it even when you've already checked out please ."
"Why don't u create something called uber grocery, which delivers grocery item to our doorstep. Or something like uber goods, which delivers any kind of good to our doorstep."
Shame you cant put half a star or none at all constantly having problems with this like the fact I orderd of it before and now its saying my address is too far from the places I order from and an order (more than once ) never arrived to my house but comes up that it was delivered and each time I go to order something it says the place is unavailable. Dont believe I'll be using this app anymore I'll be sticking to the ones that actually work
worst
Works well
💖
Good local food app
"The shittiest food delivery app... First my order was cancelled My second order is not yet delivered but has already 35 mins delay... If you are going to take people's money, maybe you should deliver some service? In India Zomato offers the food for free if delayed... And how about translating local menus to English for when people are traveling...."
Good................☆☆☆☆☆☆☆●●●●●♡♡♡♡
The driver was dropping off another order first and our food was not hot enough. Drop off was polite just dissapointed for my first time using uber eats. I will next time get it myself.
Chalta he nhin yaar
Had a few problems with refunds etc. But over all its handy to have in the area.
"Very affordable, reliable and food arrive fast"
I did not get my complete order My hot chocolate and Coke Zetro was missing and there was no receipt.
Easy to use
"I hate Uber Eats. App is terrible to use, exploits workers, taxes restaurants dearly, and tonight when exploring pick-up options for Chinese the first it lists is TWENTY-SEVEN KILOMETRES AWAY! I'm not driving that far for bloody Chinese!"
"Terrible food app. Customer service is practically non-existent so if your food is bad and you want a refund, tough luck because your not going to be talking to a person, but forced to deal with a trash user interface that feels unsatisfactory and useless. So if you want food then just go drive and get it, don't stoop down to this garbage app and compromise of the quality of your food. You'll regret it, I definitely did."
Awesome
"Food was not delivered. Hour delay, no drivers and the app refuses a refund. Incompetence at it's finest"
Too difficult to start. Kept saying my number was already taken but was my first time using the app.
Have used for work and personal use. Quick and Easy ordering.
Gd
The driver was very polite and he was friendly. I was disappointed with my food. It was cold and I expected better quality. Not ordering again with that restaurant. What a shame they lost a customer today.
Good
Was a great app until it stopped allowing me to make orders. Keeps saying that it cannot complete order and I have been unable to get assistance for a few months. I have already sent messages to Uber help but did not receive useful assistance.
We want Uber eats back in India 😭
Ever since the update you can't see where the car is anymore. I live in an apartment complex so being able to see where there are helps me direct them. The drivers are also a problem. A lot of them don't communicate well and I've had a couple take over an HOUR.
"My girlfriend ordered food on the app and waited for it, they didnt show so she called and they ignored the fact the restaurant was closed and said the order had been cancelled in the system, she talked to a sup and they hung up on her! This is absolutely horrible service and they expect her to just order food from a different place now that nothing similar is open. What a horrible experience with your service and unprofessional Management."
Very good
Love it
How to signup
Food comes to me... Ez 5 stars
Wonderful every time
"support is non-existent. I ordered A MASSIVE order. jerk before me took my order and left me with one dish. Driver called support and they told him to bring the THIEF his order even though he clearly took an OBVIOUSLY larger order that wasn't his. Uber support sided with thief, refused to help me, said I had to call myself except they have no number and did not respond on web. Then restaurant was no longer accepting orders. Made me wait 2 hours to starve"
"Update: Today order is good and so updated ranking. Original post : 最初に試したレストランは注文後キャンセル。 もう一回ハンバーグ注文しようとしたらせ一生懸命商品を選んでカートに入れたら遠すぎるから注文できないってアラートが出てまただめ。最初から見せなければ良かったのでは? 最低! First order got cancelled. 2nd burger order, only after choosing the burger carefully ,I was told that shop is too far and to clear the cart. Terrible!"
"Literally 20mins ago I paid for something I didn't even order. Took my money, app is crushing. How I can get my money back"
Love it
I love it
DOPE!!!
Support centre is useless and take forever to get back to you
Cant delete a payment method when card reported missing
Love it!
Its so easy and i love it
Amazing service! 👍
Wont accept my new address
Great app... crazy mark up!!!
"Not even available in my town, waste of time installing it. Can't use it in Ashburton, New Zealand yet its available in Christchurch which is less than 80km away. What a joke."
Great when it works but that's rare
Crashes frequently. Service often not provided.
"Good ordering app, mostly sticks to the time allocated for the order"
Works good.
Fast n good
Frequently order McDonalds using Uber Eats. Now suddenly it is nearly constantly unavailable. Quite frustrating as its not just at busy times around dinner. Glad I have menulog when Im hungry!
The app crashes on me basically everytime I try to use it despite keeping it updated all of the time.
"Ofrecen envío gratis, mandan a repartidor en bicicleta, no puede llegar a mi domicilio, cancela la orden, y aún así me cobran!!, Y para acabarla, la aplicación no permite levantar la queja, pone "" there was a problem loading this content"" que les pasa!!!!!"
"I faced some difficulties regarding the intitial login but later, I really liked the app. It had a decent presentation in terms of menus or restraus. Deliveries were always on time. I was particularly impressed when I got my complete refund for a wrong order by a restrau within 24 hours. I wish Uber Eats were not under zomato!"
quick and easy
Seems like there are less expensive fees for this app. It's probably because of where I am at and the type of restaurant I usually order from. Great app.
Every time I go on 《uber eats》there are more fees added for something!! The fees eventually exceed the actual amount of the order. McDonald's menu sucks and their individually priced items are quite rediculous!! Placss are able to take full advantage of the original in store prices!! Ugh get the gun! 😂 menu Options are boring and uninviting on app. There's no comparison to in store and a lot of the items in store are not online. That totally sucks!! Can more meal Options be added
One of sudden packs everything and left india not expected this from INC
I never got my food and customer service didnt call thr driver and didnt give me any additinal additional compensation for the inconvenience. I waited 45 mins for no food and now i have to drive while sick to get food. Thanks for nothing
Very reliable! Depends on the restaraunt but normally every order is correct and ontime!
"It started as a very convenient service. For the longest time now beside all of the fees that are now added to the food orders, it has become almost impossible to even get your order right. I have had so many issues with most of my orders as of late, that I decided to unistal the app and not use it again, especially after they stopped answering to complaints and help requests after an order is messed up, not only one, but twice on the same night, like it happened to us today. Enough is enough."
I love itttt
Awsome
Set $0 delivery fee. And then somehow got charged $5.99 for a delivery fee. And doesn't seem to have any way to contact customer service over the issue. It didn't even give me 10 seconds to cancel the order after I realized how much they were charging me
Tous est fermé ! Nul
Good so far

Great experience
"This was my first time using Uber eats.. NEVER AGAIN!!!! i am in a city i do not know, i am currently disabled and without a car.. i have very strong painkillers that require me to eat before taking or i get sick.. so i decided to get food delivered.. well that has now caused me to miss my medication and be in agonizing pain until i get food tomorrow!! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Worst food delivery service. I still cannot understand how a cab service provider could have drivers that cannot navigate a map. Very bad costumer support as well.
Great app😃 easy to use
App worked fine for months. Now everytime I log in it's asking me to enter a new address but doesnt do a single thing when I type one in. Will update review after this has been resolved. Reinstalled the app multiple times. May have been caused by the newest Note 9 update??
Everytime I order something they can never find a driver. Find a driver first then give me an ETA. Takes over an hour to find one ridiculous. Once again not able to complete my delivery fail.
"I was charged 60.73 for a order I wasnt able to get, understandable I live states away from the address listed; in the time it took to cancel and contact uber. do to terrible customer service, and support I wasnt able to get my refund or cancel so ya. I can guarantee I will continue this on and boycott them myself and recommend to anyone a different delivery system this was terrible and a waste of my money and time. Thank you for reading this and thank you uber for your terrible system."
"Drivers incessantly make ""deliveries along the way"" which are in no way on the way. As a result food shows up congealed and cold."
great
Fake
"I ordered from a local eatery, the FIRST bite I bit down on a sharp piece of bone and fragments!! Cut the roof of my mouth and really frightened me. Had I been home alone, and started choking, I shudder to think what would have happened! I informed Uber of what I had just experienced, not expecting anything more than for them to be aware of the danger that eatery posed. To my surprise, Uber addressed my issue immediately! I didn't ask for, or expect, a refund, but they did just that!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Rubbish
"When it works, its great but when resraunts become unreliable, Uber has no real way to fix reoccurring issues. They offer refunds the first few times then just stay with your money regardless if your food gets delivered or not. The convenience factor is great. However this app can make dinner with the family a complete disaster if the food doesn't arrive and all they have to say is ""We hear you and we have contacted the restaurant for you."" But %80 of the time its the drivers fault."
Great
Terrible service and user interface. No real-time help when they are screwing up your order. App leaves you stranded. Super disappointed.
"Repeat order cancellations, poor customer service. It very unreasonable to wait an hour for food to be delivered then have it canceled after a long wait. I feel disrespected and not valued. This is an unacceptable service. The point of delivery is get us food. There is no option given to assist with this and no discount option for you to order again. Its disappointing and very unsatisfactory. There should be better customer service for wasted time. I would give 0 stars over my recent experience."
👍👍
Don't expect your food to come on time. Platinum status? Uber dgaf. Your order will arbitrarily be delayed by an hour if they choose.
The only reliable food delivery app out there
"I always give an app or service at least three chances before sharing a bad review, so it's not a snap judgment - Uber Eats is THE WORST! Don't waste your time installing this app, you will be left angry, hungry and if you talk to customer service, insulted. We ordered food, delivery was delayed 2x by driver, the order was finished, only to be cancelled by the driver with no reason. Restaurant was shocked. Customer service was insolent and hung up on me! Install Seamless or Postmates and SKIP UE"
Great experience with this service.
Very bad experience. Waited more than 1hr for food delivery. Very bad delivery timing inside Wellington city. Probably should not try again.
Easy to order
1st time using Uber eats and first the driver went to the wrong address and then when I called the driver he said no he wasn't going to come and deliver he said Uber eats does not pay him to go any further then where he needs to go 😡 so very disappointed never will use Uber eats again
Awesome
Drunk AF and need some eats who do you call?! Uber Eats!!
Great app
"It's okay, a bit expensive, but, if you do end up ordering, the delivery guys, they will call you ask for your personal information, and if you are absolutely can assure them that, you ARE who you said you were, and actually are able to pay the delivery guy, that's when they will decide to come. It's like either the delivery guys aren't trained in etiquette, or the GPS tracking doesn't work on these apps."
Really good
"The best food ordering app, hands down!!!"
"Do yourself a favor and go use Postmates, Doordash, or literally ANY other delivery service because UberEATS is falling apart by the day. The worst customer service, inflated prices, and God forbid you need any kind of refund or price correction. Better hope you never have a cancelled order either because it'll be 10 days before any ""processing charges"" are returned. Even had them charge my PayPal (bank account) several days after an order had already been paid for & delivered. One word: THIEFS"
Appalling. Waited more than an hour and half for food. Then get message to say order has been cancelled. No support and no easy way to contact anyone.
App says Melinda Thomas will deliver your food then arrives John Smith. 1 minute later after payment is done and you're almost eating your food John Smith rings your bell saying the bills you used to pay are fake. I seriously don't give a single **** to this kind of human waste and unsafe premises your company relies on and supposedly allow once John Smith is delivering my food and accusing me of paying things with fake bills however this behavior just makes me wanna puke. Uber nevermore
Everyone has been so friendly and food has been excellent so far. It is very convenient especially since we work so much. Best invention ever.
Efficient
Poor errors after errors
Very good! Always on time and fast!
"Pretty good but sometimes food doesn't arrive the hottest, step it up guys"
Easy to use.
Easy and clear
Love it
"Ok at first. Customer service sucks sometimes. If a restaurant doesn't deliver your entire order, they tell you you have had too many refunds. So you lose money!"
People dont even read the instructions when it asks you to put them in.
Weeeeee
Uber Always in time. Temp of food is a restaurant time issue.
Error after error.
Easy to use and helpful tracking.
Great delivery.
"I had a confirmed order with the driver on the way. After checking my app near the estimated delivery time I discovered my order was cancelled. No text, no phone call, no email, no communication at all. This seems like a pretty basic functionality to include and not mislead people and leave them hungry."
Great
Keeps you busy and alert
This is the second time that my order was incomplete.
Have tried to do two separate orders and but would not go through....this sucks!!!!!!!!!!
Love the food
"Um lixo! Comprei crédito no pic pay, ativei no app, mas simplesmente não funciona,mesmo tendo ativado tudo direitinho nas opções de pagamento. Não percam o tempo e, principalmente, o dinheiro de vocês nesse app."
Al principio me resultó raro y diferente a rappi y pedidos ya. Pero después me acostumbré a su interfaz y me pareció dinámica.
I have received wrong orders constantly and it's so expensive. Sometimes is better we call the restaurant directly.
It's good I just have some bugs that are annoying at times. This app has come along way and I use it regularly.
Ordering from McDonalds is terrible. They often send the wrong order. I lost over £8 because they sent me the wrong order 3 times in a row and ubereats refused to refund my money after the 3rd time. I sent them the proof (receipt and photo of foods) but still refused to refund my money or send me my correct order. Very disappointing. I was a regular customer but will never order from Uber eats again. 'Just eat' is definitely more reliable and give you a refund if things go wrong. Beware!
I really wish there was a way to contact support.
"The delivery was great but the food was terrible! It was ? Days old, hard like it was cooked last week. I was very disappointed in I-57. Ive bought barbecue from them for years but wont anymore!"
Way better than skip the dishes
I can never use the app when I want to. It always shuts off in the middle of me ordering or it just doesnt load. It wont accept my card and error messages FOR EVERYTHING! Please help me sort out the issue.
Reliable! Way better than grub hub in this area
I dont have macdonald's on my app!!
Location error. My location settings are on and permissions are allowed.
Not yet available. Their hex pattern of coverage stops 60 seconds from me. Just before a neighborhood
Really easy to use. Gives accurate updates on delivery.
Uno me deja comprar y no me deja dar de alta mi teléfono
This app does not even let you confirm your order before taking money out of your ACCOUNT!! ..... I was ordering my first order... After putting the order in the basket.... Without any click or confirmation order just went through..... No option for cancelation either.....restaurant started preparing straight away... Within seconds... .. Very strange... I WILL STICK TO JUST EAT... Awful experience... Spoiled our dinner 😣
"Orders are cancelled all the time hours after they are placed. I am not sure why Uber allows you to schedule a pickup because it's always after 5pm, nothing before that. Also, if you make an order at 1, it will auto cancel by 3. The fact there is no customer support says everything about Uber. They suck"
Easy and Convenient
"I wasn't going to write a review but I changed my mind when I kept receiving phone calls about my order not being correct. I specifically ordered ""Seafood Enchiladas"" which is listed under that category. They had the driver call me to ask what type of seafood because apparently it only showed seafood and not enchiladas. I ordered chicken chimichangas under that specific category as well. Finally the lady from Guapos got on the phone. Very frustrating!"
Kinda disappointing. Orders aren't always complete or correct. I've given feedback and received no real compensation.
Some extra charges made but the app is ok
Excellent
"First of all the driver went to the wrong address. Then when they finally arrived we were missing half our order. We called the restaurant and they said ""oh it happens all the time you need to contact Uber. They take more than one order at a time and give them to wrong customers or miss them out in the car."" We then tried to call the driver and his phone was already blocked."
خدمه سيئه جددااا و انا طلبت اوردر جالي غلط و مش عارفه اكلم الي جبلي الاوردر بسبب الاختراع الفاشل اني مش هاينفع اكلمه برغم انه الرقم الي كان مسجل ده اولا ثانيا يعني ايه المبلغ ما يتردش في ساعتها و العميل الي طالب الاكل ايه النظام يشرب الاكل ولا بستانه انه يخدوا بعد ايام بجد خدمه سيئه جدا و كمان كيفية حل المشكلات اسوء بكتير و لو ينفع ما اعملش نجمه ماكونتش عملت ياريت يتم الرد ع مشكلتي
Handy deliveries. Saves leaving the house.
👌
I love this app
Great
Must snack! This helps! Especially when I'm too sick to leave the house and don't feel like cooking either.
Way better than skip the dishes
Good
"Update The customer service was supporting and resolved my problem within 1 hour. I did not receive one of my item what i ordered for my son, he is very disappointed. Also because i am new to using this app (my first time ever) i put the wrong amount of tip, which when i tried to edit, it added to the older one. However the app states you can edit the tip."
Not responsive
The worst app ever. I ordered my food waited 3 hours received NOTHING
Sem coupon de entrega gratis nao vou pedir mais.
Does not have coverage in many areas in Canada
Wonderful
There's often a problem but it always gets sorted (usually a refund). Better quality restaurants than JustEat.
Good
my order was placed 3 times and charged me 3 times also. waiting currently for customer service rep...
"Payment failed, don't worth to download it... Waste of time"
Doesn't allow you to order McDonald's breakfast even though it's been a 24/7 thing forever now. Update your app
So angry. My order was cancelled with no reason why. There is no option to talk to anyone. My phone number is correct and hasn't changed so I don't understand why someone couldn't call me
Fast delivery
Charges are way too much
Very convenient.
Great!
Great app. Very convenient and usually fast.
"How the hell should I locate my address, such a useless app"
Excellent
Needs more coupons
Decent
How come it says that the service isnt in my area yet but i have McDonald's close to me
Great delivery service
Excellent from order to delivery!
They can't find the address ever. Why should I WALK TO FIND MY FOOD. hire better people!!!!!!!!
Easy and fast
"Atendimento horrível, bugs no app, estimativa de entrega errada"
All those extra fees you charge don't go to the drivers so stop acting like they do. Sick of paying more and more money to get less and less service from all these apps.
Amazing
"JUST BEEN ADVISED BY UBER TO UPDATE BECAUSE APP NOT WORKING - EVEN WORSE! CONSTANTLY STALLS IF YOU USE SEARCH OR ORDER FROM TWO PLACES, BETTER THAN JUST EAT. Installed and used the service once before being asked to verify my credit card which I did several times to no avail. I then installed the update - same problem. I even check with the bank that all was well before uploading a different card only to be asked to verify the new card before being advised that the account was disabled. 2019"
I am trying to login but my passward or email id is not accepted in the app
Great app!!
Easy to use.
Last update causes the app to stay in address search. Doesn't change from that screen.
Great if you're lazy and don't want to get up but your order will double in price with all the fees and also they added a new feature that allows people to deliver on a bicycle so you'll get your food in a hour minimum
Quick and efficient!
🦁
I love the convenience. Never had any issues delivered on time piping hot and delicious.
Waste app
"Update as of 02/22/2020: Although I've enjoyed the app, and will still use it again, I am reducing 1 Star, due to this ""Deal"" they started by offering free delivery if you schedule the delivery. It's not worth it. You get no map and the app cancelled one minute after the 7:45-8:15 delivery window (I ordered at 6:55pm) saying the restaurant couldn't accept my order, when in fact they just had no drivers. I spoke with the restaurant and went and picked up my order. I should reduce it 2 stars..."
"In the term of food , delivery and offers it's better than both swiggy and Zomato but I just can't login it's very difficult to login again if u have deleted the app once and I just can't login again Its very very difficult please clear this issue #teamuber. If possible help me out"
It was nice
Super mal servicio de la persona en la linea de atención a clientes. No puedes cancelar tu orden aun cuando quieres cancelarla después de 1 min. Y en atencion a clientes te ofrecen cancelar la orden pero te cobran el 100% aun cuando el negocio aun no prepara los alimentos jajajaja que gran ayuda.
Well designed
One of my items were missing from my order Only received 1 x chicken strips and paid for 2 x chicken strips So disappointed 😥
Good
"This is so convenient! Each time I have gotten my food it's hot. The McDonalds I go to has an Ubereats sticker on the door, yet I can't find it in the list of fast foods. You have my vote! 🙋‍♀️"
Great app and great deals through them
Excellent service
App needs an update can't open
Very good
"Absolute rubbish, if you want an ice cold meal 2 hours late then this is the app for you. Once you have paid for the order that is the start of a lot of stress. You can not contact anyone about the order, you can also not cancel the order, even when you have been waiting for nearly two hours. Your food finally arrives when you don't really want it. Probably the worst service you could ever expect. Steer clear !"
Buena app pero malo que le suban el precio a la comida. El costo de reparto como sea pero que los platillo estén más caros no está padre.
Spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to apply a 50% promo discount that I do have in my promotions. Failed. Will order with another app.
Poor app and poor service from this uber eats please avoid
Superb!!!
Good
Convenient
Great service
getting an error like account has no password on the first screen where user is supposed to give a number to register.
Cannot remove or add my new payment method. Weird error but no option to remove old payment methods. Free delivery expired. Was excited about a mexican breakfast. Too bad...
Easy to use
Good app lad
Awesome
"Horrible every time I tried it! The app give wrong directions to its driver causing long delays, very hard to contact drivers to help with directions. When contacting customer service not very helpful. There are much better alternatives in the area that are less expensive and much quicker! My bad for letting them burn me on multiple occasions! Will not use again!"
"Disappointed they don't deliver breakfast all day, even though breakfast is served 24 hours at McDonalds."
Awesome
Awesome
"Drivers always take long, food always cold. Ubereats will never resolve complaints! Only makes life more difficult! Rather use Mr Delivery. Much better service and friendly complaint resolution."
Love how easy it is.
These people don't care how many orders they get wrong or whether or not your food arrives. I had so many orders that were wrong with food that didn't arrive. They refused to refund me and just say we understand this might not be what you want. No it's not good enough! In the eyes of the law you have stolen money from me by not providing me with the correct items. It's disgusting and I will never again use this service.
I can't order food. The app falsely says my payment options are invalid. I'm very annoyed by this.
Good
Good stuff
Why you asking download zomato app
Try to use it but ask for a passdword but nowhere to punch it in.
Everything has been as ordered.
Good
😘
Works exactly as it says it should. Provides exact feedback of where the food is.
Great app
Great
NO WAY TO STOP ANNOYING TEXT MESSAGES
I am unable to create new uber eats id. And it does very slow work for verification. So i have unstalled the app Thank you
"If this is acquired by Zomato, then why the hell are you keeping this app in playstore. Delete this, uber eats was way better than ZOMATO"
Works out good sometimes.
Love everything about this app. I cant cook period. This app is a life saver
"Quick service, no problems with delivery. Definitely will use again!"
I love the variety and convenience.
Now it is not coming
"Food was cold and order incomplete, tried to contact them for a part refund which they openly refused. Absolute BS."
"Horrible, getting wrong location all the time..."
Good
Great while I'm in London at work or with friends. Not so good in Kent but can't hate on it for that yet ..
Good
Nic app
Refuses to install on my tab yet when i try inserting the phone number on my phone it doesn't send the sms I have the buy one get one free offer i wanted to use.
Not enough delivery drivers in my area!
Good
"Why isn't it available in Protea north yet, so dissapointed"
Promotions don't work
Great app
Is Uber Eats banned in India? If yes Please Reopen it again....
Easy to use.
Nice app.
App works well
It's good for all time
Don't like zomato. They do not offer cheap as u guys used to.....😬😬😬
Excellent
Excellent
Apparently my driver is retarded. Delivered to the wrong address but still marked as delivered and charged me for it. Will not use again.
Not user friendly. Riders Take too long to pick up orders
Love... It's just amazing
My order was incorrect but there's no option to speak to anyone so you can only take a picture and message them which after 2 hours they still haven't replied. Deliveroo you can ring them if your order is wrong and they'll get a new replacement order sent out. Update....I received a reply after 3 hours which I have only been given a £0.60 refund to cover the extra sausage I had ordered but they've refused to refund the difference between the what I got and what I ordered. I'm not happy at all
A very convenient app to buy food and have it delivered.
This is best
Nice
If I knew it was that easy I would have done it a long time ago
"I opened an account using my mothers number yesterday, it is now temporarily disabled (without any orders placed). On my account i ordered 2 times before without any problems, but it's disabled too now. What should i do?"
what is the customer support number?
Terrible it won't let me checkout
Simple
👍👍👍👍👍
صصصصصثص٢ض٧
The worst food delivery app that could ever be made!
Its fine
Waste app when i forget my password i can't get my account back
"Stupid App, no cancel button, no nothing, totally hated it"
Worst app ever
Love this great to get food from places which you can't normally get a delivery from
Absolutely amazing to use !
GG
Terrible app. Always glitchy and their process is so loose that you will end up getting the wrong order 40% of the time no matter where you order from.
Difficult to use
"Uber Eats is a life saver! As a single Mom with a busy schedule and a small child, sometimes cooking is exhausting after arriving home late. Uber Eats allow me to help with homework and spend that time with my daughter instead of cooking sometimes. Service is great, food is great and I have never experienced bad customer service. I will continue to use Uber Eats regularly. 😊"
Good
Helpful
Easy to use and excellent service
Since changing my phone it will not let me log into the app i get message saying this email is already in use.
This is my first order with uber eats its been well over an hour and the app just says they are having trouble finding a driver but i cant get a refund maybe you should have a driver before you charge someone i am very displeased
Great app for scam. Uber eats here for cheating. No option for cancellations even after a second.I didn't took the food still they charge
Very sad uber eats best home delivery food apps and best discount but uber eats is close so food and discount service are not available open apps and goes to zomato apps zomato is pure discounting apps so uber eats 5 star down 1 star 😖
Frustrating I want to cancel because the time keeps going up but it wont allow me. Also I kept trying to put my address and it was not working even though I have use this app before. Wasted a lot of time and it is annoying 2 use
Great choices for food. But sometimes the food is delivered by bicycle and I've had cold food more than once.
Fantastic!!
I've never recieved an order placed after midnight before 4am. You probably shouldn't use this app.
Well developed UX
Good
Awesome
It says but ur Uber account and I don't have one and I can't find the way to be a registered
I cannot order by this app. Why do not order by this app?
"This app isn't letting me log in. Everytime I key my password it says it is incorrect and when I choose ""forgot Password"" and enter my email ID, it is being reckoned incorrect. You guys suck!!!!!"
"THEY'RE THIEVES! I used to be fond of this app but they've cross the line this time! I was not delivered some items that I ordered from KFC so they sent me an email saying that I would be refunded the entire amount not 75 SAR. The amount appeared in my Uber wallet a few days later but when I used it to order food from a restaurant, the app didn't utilize the money in the wallet but deducted from my credit card! They have no customer care number that you can contact nor can you speak to anyone!"
I can't open a new account
"False promotions and fake deals..... I ordered as specified to be granted the promo and they didn't deliver it, when I sent a ticket they just refund 50% of the promo and says order it again....."
Excellent in general but I wish there was free delivery 😓
Great service and partnered with some fantastic restaurants. Now your able to order from almost any restaurant
For past 3months ive been havibg alot of problems getting a response back from customer service on verifing my phone numder is mine and giving back to me on ur website giving me full access to my account ive lost so many GOOD MONEY SAVING DEALS that ive recently been thinking about deleting my hole account and the other issue that was aggrovating none stop all the time that when u have ur credits u cant use them
Quick and very good service
"Great experience with this app. Uber user friendly, delivery prices are sooo affordable as compared to competitors, restaurants pay attention to special requests. Overall good experience."
Very Good
Absolutely great!
"After my initial issues with set up, the app worked well"
Took my money did not bring me all my food it was cold and missing items . The driver would mot bring my food hadicap had to go up the street to get my food. Want order from uber eats no more spend to much money with these company to be done like this.
"i canceled my order but didn't do it in the few seconds that i was 'given', so they took my payment and did not refund my payment. when i contacted the restaurant where i wanted to place my order, they told me that they did not start my order because it was canceled. yet uber eats state that there will be no refund once the restaurant has started with the order, in this case the restaurant didn't even start the order, so where is my refund uber eats?"
I cannot past through after entering my phone number. Seriously?
"Watch out for Uber eats their drivers they employ steals your food while Uber eats takes your money, filling brilliant scam they running"
caro
"First time use, great service."
My app not working
Offers are not available
"Don't tell me again to d it takes me a day of work out then I'm back tk behena deme no ,que no te ok digo no por qndrieal"
Uber made it so convenient to get what you feel like having that day. The app is easy to use and the gps tracking with two way comunication is extremly usfull. You see where your food is (give or take a minute) and can make yourself readily available. I really enjoy this app and hope uber makes a personal shopper version aswell.
Don't believe in free delivery
"Good for putting order. But it doesn't allow to select delivery address on map(like uber) and when we type address its shows nearest address which is already on the map,then we have select it and type rest details again. This makes delivery guys confuse and they always go to the location shows on the map,then call and says I'm here,then I have to again guide them through phone to how to get to the correct address. This really been a nuisance, please add select delivery location on map feature."
It's okay
After downloading this app it says add ur account it doesn't even give me an option to say create an account and when I add my number it says ur account does not have a password and it does not give me option to set my password 🤔
"Won't allow me to amend my bank card details my account for ny new card without adding a second card to be able to delete the first card. Very poor system which is inconvenient, time consuming and stopped me from make a purchase through this app. Not happy. Very bad first impression. Thought uber eats would have had a much better system to update an expired bank card."
"This app works great for what it promises when it works correctly. Ive had odd ""past charges"" appear as im checking out and sometimes the food is less than equal to what ive actually ordered- which I know is a problem on the restaurant's end and not the actual app. Whenever that does occur I can just ask for a refund for what didnt appear which is super convenient and a great feature. My main problem is really just the ""past charges"" that Im sure is a problem for other people too."
It's good
Wrose app ever!!!! ×××× it
My driver stopped answering my call and we didn't get our food after waiting an hour.
I really love that you have super affordable local African food choices in there.
Food choices average ....
It's mc bloody marvelous
Very good
No complaints really. Hasn't gone wrong for me yet. That's rare these days.
Good
I was trying out the app and accidently ordered and they charged my card a cancellation fee Smh.
They uber driver stole my food plus they over charged me horrible and unprofessional
Good and fast
Pumpkin
Easy to use. Love watching the map.
On time delivery
wonderful
Awful one of the people that work for this never showed up he never contacted me the worst app he stole the food and he has free food .I want my money back
Extremely horrible. There is an issue with the sign up process. I only have one email and it's registered to an old phone number 🖕
"Some really nice food places in my area aren't listed, but the service itself is really good!"
Excellent
I hate ordering through uber eats because these places constantly cancel my order with no reason and I constantly get screwed over. At least when your order gets cancelled on grubhub or door dash they will give you a free delivery or credit towards next order for the inconvenience
"When installing the app, Uber asks for a number, great that works; then Uber asks for an email address - I use the email address that's been registered prior and I get an error that the email has already been registered, but that's the point, however I'm not able to log in. In an attempt to login with a registered email, I cannot login to the app. You force me to use a brand new email just to register. Allow me to use the email I want then I'll update to 5 stars."
"Have yet to get an order withing 30 to 45 min of estimated timeline. Door dash has been far more reliable. 3rd strike your out, this is my last order ever with Uber Eats."
Food fine but excess wait kept getting an extension to delivery time then saw driver was there for half hour at least before food ready
Very poor
"Very misleading , received an sms to the promotion buy 1 get 1 free, i uploaded and installed the app and pressed on the promotional banner , started ordering, nowhere on the app does it show buy 1 get 1 free, i left a comment requesting promo, but only to find , driver only brought 1 meal."
excellent!
FIX YOUR APP
Good
Great app 👍👌👏
तू तो बिक गया रे चंद रुपयों के लिए। अब हमें आफर कौन देगा।
"I don't recall creating an account. This App says I did though. 5 * just, for being ""Uber"" yeah' baby!"
Can't get your app to work
Hate this
Good
"Lag, lag, lag, everything overpriced ......"
Great
"I can't log in to my account its a very bad app i don't recommend it at all Edited - they helped me to login, thanks uber eats"
"I've been using uber eats for a few years and I've finally hit my breaking point, the orders are consistently wrong and arrive late, then when I ask for a refund the only give me a part of the delivery cost, FOR FOOD I NEVER RECIEVED. deleting the app, never using again."
They got my complete order wrong after a good 45 min wait
Bings food fast but my order is never right. I pay for food I don't get. 🤔 I get told I can't get a refund. Hope who got my food enjoyed it
I've got a lot out of this app
"Worst app I added $100 to my account and I'm unable to use it, the customer service supervisor hung up on me worst service ever"
Deliveries are really over priced vs other app don't use too expensive
Satisfying
First time using this app and love it
Great
To expensive they put food price up
Excellent for my lazy & late night desires while remaining safe in my home instead of attempting to drive while under any influences.
To expensive for drivers not to atleast use heating bags.
"Help should be easier to reach through the app. I spent a while getting a refund for an order that I'm pretty sure wasn't really my fault. A coupon they sent was misleading, it said 20 eur min order (when in reality it meant 20 eur min AFTER coupon is applied), I cancelled an order right after confirming it. Initially got charged 25 eur cancellation. Clarity on cancellation fees, also make it a reasonable amount please. Their customer service sounds so unhappy,sorry I was angry, it was at uber:)"
Every thing was amazing
Very good
Solid and easy to use
"Doesnt work, constantly says error processing request. Does not matter what account or device I use. Even when I use new payment options."
"I love uber eats app its very convenient! What i usually have an issue with is the fast food place i order from (Forgettimg items that i paid for) or the drivers (Wromg car,Rude , slow ect) .i think uber eats should make the food places send in conformation of the complete delivered orders so uber eats knows how they are doing as far as their service and performance because if its not good people could blame uber instead of the right company or employee. But overall i am thankful for uber eats!"
等十世都未到
I c Burger King!
"Finding the talk to person option isn't easy to find and then they dont help you. Had a canceled order they saw it on their end and neglected to inform me. I am checking the app during the scheduled delivery time and no information given. After the delivery time expired that is when I was informed I wasn't getting any food! All I got from the information line is ""I understand your frustration"". I have a family to feed. If I need to find a different option I need to know about it immediately!"
Not needed
"We miss uber eats, it's better than other all food dilevery applications Stupid decision of selling the application."
I ordered food and the restaurant only gave the the delivery driver half of the food he went back to the restaurant to get the other half and they still missed an item the food was cold by the time I received it they refunded the money for the missing item and the spilled item bit they seem to thank a 5 dollar Uber credit for the cold food was sufficient yeah like that's makes me want to order again and get another messed up order
Good to have
Awful app. Awful service. Waited over 90 mins for a McDonald's delivery....with three different drivers 'arriving' at McDonald's to pick up the order. Customer service was frankly useless.
Good
"Where the hell are my pickles? I order from wawa I ask for a side of pickles in the requests section since the option isn't available in the menu on uber eats like it is in store. I've asked 3 or 4 times, never gotten pickles. Wawa pickles are the bomb that's why I want them. If I had the ability to message the person picking up my food before they pick it up, I would, but you can't contact a delivery person until after they pick up your food. Not a great app"
"Very popular app used by many to get their food delivered. Restaurants, Hotels may vary according to the area. Most of them provide good food.Enjoying the offeres everytime. Great app.👌"
I love it
"After open app , ask password without set my password"
Very nice driver & food was good
"Great way to get food if you're busy, or just can't get out, but you pay for convenience."
Deceptive experience...it is very dificult to get customer support..the help options are useless...many false or wrong promotions...they end up charging you more than what was showed on your order...and customer service does not do anythong about it....the app is incredibly buggy and freezes
"The app basically sucks. Long story short, took my money never gave it back. Apparently it takes 10 days to process the money back but it doesn't take long to charge the account. A very disappointing experience as I was looking forward to my order till it was cancelled for some bloody reason. Never using this app again."
It's not perfect and sometimes things get messed up but over all not bad
Canceled my account and made me an Uber Driver? No way! Had to dump app and reload. Kept asking me are I wanted to deliver to.
Very fast and reliable
Options dont reflect actual options and the app wouldnt even let me place an order.
a way=-O
The interface freezes randomly in some instances.
This app never works. Literally never. No matter what I do it just gets stuck on the address screen giving an error.
Great experience. No real complaints.
Poor service. Extremely slow delivery. They have cancelled my orders twice after making me wait for 30 min.
"Order food, over an hour later food never delivered. Uber Support was absolutely no help. Gave me a refund, (which I was already entitled to) wasted almost 90 minutes during dinner time. Service is absolutely useless."
"Mala, nunca tiene promociones, un problema agregar o quitar medios de pago y evidentemente te cobran más de lo que consumes, ya que quiero pagar mi cena y en mi tarjeta esta el importe exacto y me dice que no tengo fondos suficientes"
"After the last update, every single restaurant I attempt to order from is now too far from my home to deliver to. The app is fundamentally useless to me now. Thanks for nothing."
Convenient!!
Terrible service. Driver complained he would get a ticket if he parked to deliver. Cancelled order. NO PHONE NUMBER ANYWHERE TO CONTACT UBER EATS. TERRIBLE lack of customer support.
App don't work
"Making a payment was impossible, even after calling everyone and being told everything looks fine and it should work. Nope.. I thank tried uninstalling and reinstalling, etc... still doesn't work. Too much of a headache which of course we all have now all lost our appetite."
Terrible. Just terrible. Waiting nearly 2 hours for a meal. This makes no sense. Do better Uber Eats.
Easy interface. Lots of options. Saves favs
Generally good but the occasional issue (such as postion of place marked a block down the road) does annoy at times.
It's easy to use and convenient.
Very good
Great in most respects
New bug where you can't follow the car anymore to track your order and know when to be outside.
Timely service.
Good
Love it
Very good
Best app ever
"Easy to navigate, friedly for users. FAST and secure service"
"It's user-friendly, it's interactive, and it's colorful."
Great
It's so easy and user friendly for those us still learning tech
Excelente aplicacion y servicio
Excellent service!
Always good service
Great app tracking delivery is a great feature
I usually have a good experience. My only recent complaint is food not arriving hot. Maybe drivers should carry a bag that keeps food warm/cold
I can't login and when I try to sign up it says that I my email is already taken
"I haven't had many issues with the app until now. It's been asking me to put in a new delivery address but because I've already had an address attached I'm not understanding why it's asking me that. And even when I'm trying to put in my address, nothing is coming up it keeps giving me ""error fetching location search results"". I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times. I've tried resigning into my account. I have no idea what's wrong and I'm kind of upset."
Love you guys
"This is my first time using the app, and it has alot of my info but it won't let me go forward because I don't have the same ph.# and there is no place to tell you that.What do I do?"
Love uber! Better than Grub Hub
Very happy with my orders
"Decided to order today for me and 3 children. Surprised when arrived 5 mins later as the drive is longer. Has load of nugents and milk shake, explained not my order and said he'd be back, never seen again. Called Uber who said no refunds, I have no food and you have stolen my money, do I go to the police next??? Avoid at all costs, never had money stolen in this fashion before, just another online scam! I will be taking further as these beed shutting down!"
"Deserves 0 stars. Ordered food at 500. Delivery time was set for 630, which was rediculous as it is, but then my order was canceled at 550pm. No text, no message, no call. I went to the app to check on my delivery, and saw it was canceled. Deleting this app right now. Bite squad has never done this to us."
Easy to use but I would prefer to be able to use the entire menue
"Had an order 'delivered' but never actually got the food, the only way to follow this up is with terrible pre-set list of complaints and a 'live chat' system. 2 hours I have been waiting so far for any response from this system. Just god awful customer service."
Worst company ever too order from they admitted there driver stole my food yet still didn't offer any help or any compensation. How can a company tell you there driver didn't follow protocol and still not do anything absolute shocking company
"I've tried ordering mcdonalds with this app twice. First time, it was missing an item. Second time, it was the completely wrong order. I'd been given someone else's order, reported it, and had to wait over half an hour. I'm starving, Uber Eats. Give me the food I paid for!"
Siempre que he pedido sin excepción ha tardado más de dos horas de la hora prevista de entrega sin opción a cancelar el pedido o alguna explicación o compensación. Just Eat no te volveré a ser infiel.
so far I have had a 5 star experience
How the hell does company even still exist? I've have never had such a bad service in my life. Can't even sign in because it wants a new address.... Never changed my address. I put in my address the app does absolutely nothing! It's never clear about what to do next. I even tried becoming a driver.. biggest waste of time ever! Jus can't get any of the Uber apps going!
Works every time
Nice
Great
"The restaurants sometimes dont give the full order. But the app itself is accurate, and the customer support staff are timely if there are complications"
Very convenient. Great app.
The app will not let me sign in nor gives me the option and states that I'm already registered. It only gives me the option to register.
"Had a 20$ coupon, applied it to my order ,said it was applied. My total was told and it was 50cents. A week later I go check my bank account and my 20$ are gone from the same order + my 20$ uber rebait for inviting a friend was used for NOTHING!! I LOST 40$ AND UBER DOESN'T WANT TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. DON'T INTALL THE APP IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENS TO ME!!"
Makes my cooking life easier
Customer service is the worst. I can't get a hold of anyone to help me with my order issue.
Second time with no sauce
I ordered a happy meal and the chips was missing. And the food was cold too 😠
Awful
Quite expensive delivery.
"My first order was cancelled after 30 minutes of wait time, received a generic email explaining there was an inconvenience (didn't explain what) and doing me the favor of not charging me the order..."
Decent but have failed last couple times
The service is good but the price is higher
"For some reason so many restaurants keep going on and off available while ordering ,very upset because there is no explanation"
"Arrived late and cold. I believe because 2 other orders the rider was waiting for. Will not order again. Expensive for cold food, but states it reduces cost= not effective"
RIP UBEREATS IN INDIA
amazing app and great delivery time
"Only wanted to try it, now I can't remove my payment method."
Super thanks
Rubbish app. GPS constantly shows wrong address. No verification .
I give it 4 stars could be better could have better selections of restaurants but overall good quality fast delivery and good service
"Ever since the new update, its been kind of lagging when it comes to the drivers and their location. However, overall a good app. And customer service is great when something goes wrong."
"After a recent update. Uber Eats made it so that delivers fee are a dollar but still charge for service fee. Not to mention if your order is under a certain amount, they'll add another fee and finally to top it off. They make it so you HAVE to tip the driver BEFORE they deliver your food. Honestly, after today I will be removing the app and looking for another alternative. Honestly, don't order from your local restaurants, paying almost 50% more than you would if you were to go there yourself."
We use a lot. Would be 5 but too often missing items
Awesome but expensive😅
take your money...no delivery...poor service
"O App é bom, mas se precisar do suporte você vai ficar na mão. Eu não recebi a entrega e não teve nenhuma tentativa de contato por parte do entregador. Eles rejeitam o meu reembolso e quando reclamei falaram que o entregar veio e ficou esperando 10 minutos e que tentou entrar em contato, porém eles não tem nenhuma prova dessa tentativa e fecharam o meu suporte. Estou bem indignado sobre o posicionamento deles."
13p is all the refund you will get if your order or food items are missing .be warned..even if ten pounds worth is missing refund will be 13p and if you argue your point across the close your complaint.
Great app. Never any problems. I use it all the time.
"Bad points; It doesn't deliver the sauces, ever! Theres no way of leaving a message for the kitchen or the driver. Awful user interface. Good points; McDonalds."
My driver was on time. He delivered my food straight too my front door.
Frustrating stupid app couldn't get an order through.
"Experience is Ok, however when help or need to contact Uber needs to inproove. I could not speak to anybody, as my phone number was not recognised, very frustrating"
"Absolutely appaling no one to get hold of on the phone to put a complaint in, took money for an order that never turned up. Very annoyed at this"
"Disaster. Do not use this app. UBER take no accountability for the quality of the restaurants on their platform. Use Deliveroo, they have quality guidelines and a positive customer service."
Good service!!
All good so far!
Best food app ever
Confusing to use. No confirmation of delivery address at the check out. Sent order to previous address which was a pub.
Uber basically r u ever going to deliver to irlam
Brilliant
Still needs some improvements.
"Trash. The app glitches out, so you don't think you have a meal coming until someone will show up with your food. I'll continue to pay $3.99 plus for delivery from DoorDash."
"Works fine. But is it just me, or does choosing pickup prevent the app from showing the restaurant address? I have no idea where this place is and there are 4 of them in my city. Not helpful"
Good
"(Reply to UBER comment) That's incorrect. All the restraunts turn of at the same time. You've lost my custom at least 9 times now. If I could give this app 0 stars I would.. where do I start. I open the app, I'll put my order in go to check out and surprise surprise they don't deliver to my house (I'm 3 minutes away they do deliver to me because when the app decides to work I'm able to place an order) I have to refresh the app 20 times for it to work again to then repeat the process."
Worse delivery drivers
"Took driver 30 minutes, after picked up food to go 1 mile. She kept getting lost! Won't use ue again"
Not bad.
Great
Tbis is yhe best apo in the world
Its very great if they can get these folks to stop cancelling my orders but other than that its awesome
Cancel app
"Great app! There are a few restaurants who say that they don't receive the order through the system, but only through the drivers. After receiving the order from the driver, they start working on the order, which makes the order take too long to be prepared and delivered to the customer. However, overall, it's a wonderful app."
Fastest deliveries I've seen
They are not professional When u want to cancel the deal they chareged u with the amount & not delivered the good
"Excelente servicio, las órdenes estimadas llegan casi al momento que te la dice la app."
The bad experience ever - Sign Up na korei log in korar option hoye & again option ase sign up korar - faltu app
"Effective, user friendly but has weird bugs sonetimes"
Always good untill an unauthorized payment was taken out
"You guys keep sending promotion, that don't work. Fix your problems first or don't bother to send promotions. Thanks"
Deliver drivers take too long
Very very good app and delivers food on time
I gave simple instructions to come to my door and knock. There were two or three times they called instead and I miss there call. So no food and a waste of money. My orders were at least thirty dollars a piece. I called to get my money back each time and they said they was going to refund me and never did. I dont care what promotions they throw me I'm never using them again.
I can't get pass the delivery address... it keeps saying error fetching location
Good delivery
It's good but risky. Very risky.
"I cannot access the app. It keeps saying that I opted out of sms's and when I opt back in by messaging START, nothing happens. So I haven't been able to use this and the Uber app either."
Good verry good
They always deliver extremely late.
Had to reinstall app and now its saying email already registered so because I've had to reinstall I can't use it really bad app design
Great
It sucks the server is always done and I haven't been able to order food on it since I downloaded the app
Very good app. Easy to place order & food arrives in good time as per the estimates given. Promotional offers from time to time which are great. Good choice of restaurant/places to order from with many tasty and different types of cuisine to choose from. Highly recommended this app 😊
Too much lag
"Uber decides to add additional deliveries along your route WITHOUT your permission. So I paid full price for delivery, to receive cold food because Uber decided to send the driver on a separate delivery route while transporting my food. When you order an Uber ride, you have an option to Uberpool or ride in UberX by yourself and pay the difference. But nooo with Ubereats, you pay full price and they decide whether your food will be ""Uberpool"" or not. Very inconsiderate."
Good all the way
Disgusting I got the wrong order and nothing is being done about it
I can't order anything and I don't know why. The error message is generic.
"I haven't been able to type in a note for my order for a few days now. I have been getting deliveries with no utensils, no sauce, no napkins, because uber drivers are leaving the restaurant before I can call them to grab some extra things. this especially a problem for fast food orders where i need condiments for my order, and it would be easier to type it into my orders. Everytime I order I never get any utensils or condiments."
"Uber eats sent someone to walk to my house in the rain for 20 minutes, my food was cold, the guy asked me to rate him 5 stars, i felt bad for him so I rated him 5 stars but uber eats refuses to refund me for my cold food, why would uber eats allow people to walk with their customers food in cold raining weather?"
"Am so pissed with the service I received. I made an order and the guy said he was at the gate. When I called, the person who answered told me that the owner of the fone left the fone and he will contact him. Later I receive a notification that he tried calling me, but dololo missed calls. I called him back, he said he is coming 2min done the line my order is cancelled. I paid online, and now my money gone. Am not happy at all. When I try to re order am getting a erros saying the place is far fro"
Love this app. It just works really well
It's easy
Bakwas ... Bahancho bhuka mar rha tha kya jo zomato ko bech diya
"Full of bugs,keeps freezing.and they make it super complicated to communicate when something goes wrong."
Terrible service. Driver never dropped off food and said they did. No accountability for the driver who didn't care to get the food to the right address. Customer service doesn't care either. Two and half hour wait for food that never got here. Can't rate the driver or service received because they closed that. Shauna the driver is lacking in brain capacity. I'm not sending anything outside of this message here. If you have a resolution to my situation post it here.
"Drivers late and can't follow basic directions. Will never order on this app again. 2020 edit: Their system is completely rubbish. Everything is automated with no option to talk to a human being, and no clear directions for problems/errors. Definitely not giving them another chance."
every time i have tried to order food from this i sit there and watch the timer go up and up and up then the order cancels its self. ive never had a driver actually show up with my food and i have tried 3 times. how do they even make money off this thing if no one works for them and the people working for them. cant handle the amount of people ordering.
"The app won't allow you to input your address correctly. It's stupid that when I keep editing the address, it keeps changing it."
Wrost management i have ever seen.Order from pathao or foodpanda they are far better than uber🤬
Had an horrible experience. Made a request. It never came. Didn't get to eat at work that day. Submitted a ticket. Nothing happened. Uninstalled the app. Not gonna download it again. Please stop sending me spam to my email.
Good
Rubbish setup
Worst customer service
"Ubereats uses Restaurant discount as their app discount, while the other app give both restaurant and app discount."
"When the food has arrived cold or you need to make a complaint, nothing gets done. I havent receieved any feed back or any way to ressolve an issue."
I don't know why ub eats are not delivered in my proper location
The app stops working as soon as I place an order. The food never arrives and you have to beg for a refund. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
Good
Clown service. I live literally 7 minutes away from where i order. Poor driver is one hour late. Uber eats will not answer any number. Zomato are bad . Uber eats also as they have zero support. They let driver take all responsibility. Its a circus
"Fiz um pedido dentro do app onde dizia leve 2 pague 1, onde selecionei um produto. Mas quando chegou, veio só a metade. Fui na ajuda e recebi uma resposta dizendo que foi um mal entendido, que aquele produto não estava dentro desta promoção, sendo que eu cheguei nele através do banner leve 2 pague 1. O pior ainda foi a interação do suporte, que não dá direito de resposta. Até agora está disponível pra mim a promo e falaram que eu me enganei. Ser enganado com fome é péssimo 😠"
Rather get a root canal at the dentist than use this app.
This apps Great and it has great service from the few times I've used it 😁
Uber eats is trash!
App is really good but some items from takeaway menus are not shown
Very good app. Very helpful.
Very poor service Ignored my instructions and below par meal I also collected myself but couldn't remove the R10 delivery fee. I expect a refund
Wonderful
Effefient service
Goooooooood very good i love it
Unable to open uber eats in my phone
"While the app works fine from an ordering point of view, the estimated delivery is quite bad in our experience (our by approx an hour). We've had hit and miss experience using uber eats, something its great, however once our food just never arrived at all and other times the time estimation is way off."
very fast delivery service
Fast
"It cool for my lazy stoner ass.. I dont like the small order fee, I could be using that on my GG4 sack to blaze.👅👅👅👅"
Useless
Buggy.
"Поставил приложение, просит ввести номер телефона, но никакой возможности продолжить. Разрабтчили совершенно не тестируют свои приложения! Вообще не понимаю как можно выпустить неработающие приложение!"
Good
Bakwaas
"Easy, convient to use."
Sa.
Expensive food .
Pretty good
Extra vat is unreasonable compared to it's competitors.
"Some of the drivers are a little sketchy sometimes, I wish we had the option to choose which driver we want that's available and be able to see their reviews/stars"
I miss uber eats.
Easy too use
🥞🥞🥞🥞🥞🥞🥞
"Good App, easy to use."
My orders always get messed up
Great app
Mast app
"Estimated delivery time and the person picking up the order changes every 15 minutes. Been waiting for food for more than 1 hour 30 minutes. Everytime I check it gives different name of the driver. After almost 2 hours of waiting, it says 'order cancellaed, courier was unable to deliver'. What a disappointment"
Good app
"Won't run on a google pixel 3a xl. Sad. Edited: And apparently, UberEats can't even give enough effort to actually reply to a negative review. That's a link to their generic ""help"" section, not a method of contacting them. So they can't put in enough effort to make the app function on a modern device, and can't put in enough effort to reply to people when they're frustrated that the app won't work on their devices. So in other words, they're throwing out a net to capture as many hapless suckers as possible to waste overblown money on an app that overcharges, doesn't tip restaurants or servers, sneakily raises prices without telling you, won't give you accurate estimates on delivery times, and won't even bother to make sure it'll function at stealing your money. What an absolute load of tripe. No, UberEats, I'm not going to go through the process of navigating through your website's help section, finding a method of contacting you (Which I'm /certain/ you've hidden behind dozens of links because you can't be bothered to actually answer me), and go through the process of taking a class on learning how to use your website. This went from a nine word review to an over-two-hundred word review because you halfassed your response so very poorly. Food apps are literally the worst. Waste your time spending on another gacha game, you'll get more satisfaction and nutrition out of your life with less time wasted."
Wish we could order from 2 places at once.
Super good food
Useful time saving
Enjoyed
What would we do with out you guys
I have been able to reach customer service each and every time I call it for whatever reason I disconnect it before someone picked up they always called me back and it's not necessarily that I'm having a problem with Uber per say it may be just the restaurant that I'm having a problem with but they do correct the problem
"Really poor after sales support. When their drivers fail to deliver, they cannot solve the issue, but instead will send you automated messages. Mr Delivery offers far better local support. If you log a support about more than one issue, they threaten to block your account for abuse. *Edit:* I received the same standard reply from the developer. Your support refuses to help any more. See order C6CEC, support replied by saying ""we won't be able to respond to further messages on this issue."""
Worst app. biggest cheater in the world giving offers for 40 aed purchase 30 off but there is no quantity in food they are giving only 10 AED quantity.. Biggest cheater in UAE.
App glitched and placed 2 orders and they customer services ridiculous emailing me they can't do any think i have to pay double even though I tried cancelling instantly
Very responsive to any inquiry
Great works well.
Great love it
This app doesnt cover Bowling Green KY so me being charged for a subscription i know i didnt setup watch out with google pay i think thats how i got a charge 9.99. Now getting that returned has been jumps and leaps still no real answer and results so this app sucks... Saddened...
Nice
"I had only just installed the app so clearing the cashe does nothing. Instead of blaming it on people's phones accept responsibility and fix your app!!! For all those reviews about the wait time increasing, I work for uber eats and that will normally be down to drivers using more than one delivery app like deliveroo and they are prioritizing other orders before yours or picking up an order from somewhere else before they deliver your food."
After upgrading tona new phone this app won't let me sign back in. I enter mobile number then enter the cide but when utvasks for my email address it tells me that the email has already been used. There are No other avenues from these first few screens to log in abother way.
Good
It's okay but should reward loyal customers. New customers seem to get all the best offers.
"Dużo bledow, działa jak chce. Jak jest promocja na coś na bank tego nie zamowisz, a nawet niczego innego z tego lokalu. Nie da się odwołać mocno opoznionego zamówienia, mimo, że i anuluje się samo po 1,5h. Jedzenie dostarczane bez związku ze wskazanym w aplikacji czasem dostarczania. Zawsze ta sama wymówka: dużo zamówień,bez względu na to, o której godzinie byś nie zamówił. Kurier często dłużej jedzie z zamówieniem niż doszedł by na piechotę."
Help fully
U have just wasted urself by being sold by Zomato
"Food was good. But I like the most, their timing was great👍."
Fast deliver
"Delivery depends upon the driver. Some cannot follow directions, so the food is cold. A delivery from two blocks away can involve a 12 block detour when the driver doesn't know the area or follow directions. Limited restaurants late-night which is a drag for guys like me who work late. On the other hand, some of the drivers are awesome and hard-working, so that is a plus."
Gold and fast
Só problemas
Excellent rapid delivery ...lots of options
App is standard. Got my account disabled within the first order and managed to order myself breakfast and they delivered it elsewhere. Now have missed out on food because people they hire can't read addresses. Seriously bad service
Best service fast delivery very accurate!
Good
"Had an experience with a bad delivery, lodged a complaint with the system and I still haven't recieved a response. The system is to automated, doesn't allow for resolutions for dissatisfied customers"
Food is excellent . Hot and well pack
really missing this app..once upon a time this app helped me..i stayed in Bengaluru for 3 months ..i used to get food by this app only...But now no Uber eats:(
Good
""" The best thing ever invented """
Awesome app.
"Update: Tried to add a new cc, but it didn't accept. I didn't have much time and was about to make an order worth 1500 riyals for our work group. Right as I was about to check out the app kicked me out and I got greeted with an Account Disabled message. I got locked out of the app. Hilarious stuff. Hopped over to hungerstation, added cc info and ordered in less than 2 mins. On top of that, their customer service called twice to make sure delivery was timely. Anyways, App deleted."
"Uber in general is an awful company to work for, being customer or any other relation to it. EDIT: What details would you like to have? About the income? About the way you treat drivers? The bots that you use for written customer service or the Philippines telephone customer service which don t have a clue about the actual app. The fact that you always get the maximum number of drivers anywhere you are (town,country) to maximize your profits while drivers struggle to maintain their cars etc."
Nice app
Best idea ever!!
Orders I attempted in the last few months have been ridiculously late and has trouble finding a driver.
Exaggerated promotions. Insist that I have a free delivery when it's only half off and dont deduct what they claim to when they say spend 15 get 3 off. Keep an eye on these guys. Classic case of massive slippery corporate c***s
I ordered a soup from a near by restaurant through this app and it was delivered to me with empty container and soup was all in the bag. The rider was in a rush and he just threw balance and food at me and rushed away. I have used the app for several times nothing like this happened before. I think uber must get rid of such riders and restaurants who even dont know how to deliver a food to a hungry man
Good service
"Doesn't delete old addresses, sometimes fails to update when changing address, multiple times my order has gone to the wrong place"
Fair
Excellent.
Good.
Terrible customer service and overpriced
Im in love with their service and convenient menu
Awesome!!
Goood
Have used another delivery app and this one is streets ahead.
Its not user friendly
Big yeet
Worst app
You're just great guys
Great
Why close in India? I love Uber eats. It's price was good except zomato and swiggy.
Best app. Works fine w/o any issues or glitches
This is a good app. No issues. Refunds are easy to get to.
Amazinggg
"Pakka khankir cheler app, sala bokachoda bondho korte ke bolechilo surorer baccha. Koto maya joriyechilo mdrchod sala"
Great Experience
I will 🏌️ not join Zomato😏😏
It's amazing.
Never had a problem since I been I download this app
Is a very good app I think that the fees can be a bit much sometimes
It's great when you're travelling and you don't know where to eat. Also great if you have had too many wines
Good
"Rubbish, can't scan credit card, the least uber can do is get their technology right"
"This app has recently become annoying! Our local McDonald's which 1.2 miles away frequently comes up as ""Not in range"" or intermittently unavailable, often in the middle of making an order, add to that the very iffy GPS showing the driver spinning around on the spot Or rubber-banding when on the way to the restaurant, or delivering... This app used to work, subsequent 'fixes' and updates have done the opposite! UPDATE: Tried uninstalling and clearing the app cache to no effect, still issues!"
👌👌👌👌
I ordered food from big bite Biriyani 2 times and have been charged for it. Twice it has been cancelled by uber ears and not delivered. I have spent 2x1860 rs. I need a refund I am very disappointed as I can't even call uber eats to request for the food
Good
"Easy to use, sometimes glitches. It's generally a good app that looks good and tracks your orders live."
How do I delete an address
Awesome
Best delivery app
Fast and furious
Always fast and efficient
Shocking service! Shocking support. Don't care for your drivers and mess them around there are issues. This is the second time the app processed the wrong address which forced a cancelation by choosing from the other side of town. Shocking. The wanting to charge me the same price of my order as cancelation fees! Hate this app. Hate Uber. Will stick to any other service other than Uber!
Delicious
"Doesn't load, or let me log in. Gives me a enter deliver address. Wont go past that updated uninstalled and reinstalled. Won't be using again. As I've now uninstalled it again (written this review for a 3rd time as it keeps getting deleted)"
The food got here on time. The driver was also friendly. I'm happy with the service.
life saver
Very good app
great
Good
It's fast and put customers first that's one thing I love about this app
GOOD FOOD IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA.
I like using this app
"Food is usually punctual. Sometimes you have sketchy delivery people and sometimes rude people, but on the whole, a decent delivery service."
The best App for having your food delivered and the service is 100% great
Good
The app & food delivery has been great.
ぐっど
F____kin A!!!!
Fast food is fast and good
It would help if it would choose the closest restaurant for you..
They listen and see if they can find a way to make it right for you and your future orders.If something goes wrong with your order they will not hesitate to make it better for you .
Awesome thank you
Fast and good service
Tryed to start it and its saying fails yo get message
Useful app.
"No te deja cambiar dirección si te equivocaste a diferencia de otras apps, los repartidores no buscan ayudarte si necesitan cambiar algo y no aceptan cambios o que recomiendes alternativas. No contestan y se acaban quedando con la comida y cobrándote"
pretty good
Drivers usually don't know the area they're driving about which causes cold meals and inconvenience. Also had a few instances where somebody completely different than the driver ID would bring me my food.
Sick of getting cold food because delivery drivers go in opposite direction to deliver another order first.
"i ordered 5guys and it kept delaying my order as they said they were ""preparing it"" and then the app closed so i never got my food. if theyre not going to do an order, dont process it."
Comes in handy when the regular stores closes and when you want some new to eat
"The only real problem is that when I order something from these fast food places is that when the wrong food is delivered or lack of,. .The restaurant says it's not their fault, but it is...SOMEBODY needs to figure out how to make it easier for customers and COMMUNICATE with each otherto make sure order is correct, considering how much it costs."
"I love how at certain times there is a free delivery fee for certain places. Everytime I order my food, it comes faster than expected, and the delivery person is always friendly. I've used this app more than I'd like to admit. 10/10 would reccomend."
Useless app. UberEats doesn't accept my credit card but same card works fine in Uber app. Tried different credit cards and I keep receiving payment error. If only I could rate 0/5.
Always Done Right. Always Good Tasting.
Says it'll deliver only in a small circle around McDonald's but won't expand to maybe 5 minutes further out of the tiny tiny tiny circle. Pizza hut delivers farther out and is further away.
"Ordered some food that was delivered extremely lacking. I ordered sprinkles and got about 3, so I requested a refund. I was told that the size of the food (What?) was nothing they could control, and no refund would be issued. Completely useless. Stick to GrubHub, Postmates and DoorDash. They all will make sure you're satisfied with your food and refund if necessary. EDIT: I already messaged your company twice and they have no intention of refunding me. Continue on with your needful."
My experiences have always been pleasant!
No problem with the app. Seems to do what it should.
Sucks as it wont confirm my order as completed yet if I cancel your goi g to charge me . So now I know not to use uber eats again.live and learn
I shouldn't have to call support to confirm that it's being sent to the correct address. My wife and I use our account for multiple locations as needed and it's really annoying to select that I want it sent to location X and not be able to see/confirm that its going to location X and not location Y. SHOW WHERE THE FOOD IS BEING DELIVERED TO ON THE RECEIPT/INVOICE.
Good customer service.
Awesome. Getting super fat.
Told to contact support via email full out red star areas to update my account I get started a new account and now cant update the original account told to call support for help and upon checking my resources I cant help you you need to email uber to change account info stop it sourcing work and give it to the people of the USA NOT A FOREIGN COUNTRY FOR HALF THE COST
Great app
"Great overall, time estimates sometimes optimistic"
"Terrible, half the time the fees are more than your food doubling the cost. But don't worry guys they have your back if you PAY THEM monthly they will wave your delivery fee we the small conditions of it being over 20, but you still have to pay the fees and taxes as well. What a joke."
"Kinda Awful Really. Ive used this app numerous times a college student in Philly. I cant tell you how many times the drivers have straight up taken my food - 5min away from delivery, making me wait for nothing. Or missing key items, or reeking of weed. And i have to pay upwards of $10 extra for rhis service? Abysmal. Only postive is that Customer Support is indeed helpful. But this treatment is tiresome. I don't want to use this service anymore. Its costly and unpleasant way to frequently."
"Never works, saying ""something went wrong"", whenever I try to open the app"
"Yo vi claramente que el restaurante No había aceptado esto! Y me apareció una notificación al presionar cancelar que van a cancelar sin ningún cargo! Entonces cual es la robadera??? Incluso en la App me dice que NO se cobro nada! DEVUELVAN MI DINERO! ESTO NO PUEDE SER POSSIBLE, SI LA APP ME HUBIERA NOTIFICADO QUE SE VA GENERAR UN CARGO, JAMÁS HUBIERA CANCELADO! DEVUELVAN MI DINERO,!!!!!!! YO NO ESTOY LOCA PARA PAGAR 2 VECES!!! Puedo enviarles capturas!!! Gente ubereats anda ROBANDO"
I can't order anything. I get sent straight to delivery details and it won't let me enter anything else.
"Best app for ordering food with real time tracking where the driver is at with your food. A lot of restaurants to choose from, so we are not stuck with fast food during this long kitchen remodel we are going through."
Great
Five star
I was hungry and it kept telling me my email address was already registered when I tried to login. There was no where else to put my email address. I was trying to login. I'm still hungry.
It glitches sometimes.
Hair in my food and missing items
So far great service
"Works well functionally, people are on time and have treated my food with care."
This is the best
With the update all of my info has disappeared. I can't get my address to populate and can't see any restaurants
"This company is a joke with their customer service. Takes the 15 minutes to pull your money, 2 Hours to mess up and order that never comes, and 3-5 days to refund you your money. They constantly mess up orders or in our case fail to deliver completely. Then your spoken to like your a slow child and not even offered Credit so you can re-order. It's not worth the ridiculous service fees and luke warm food."
Great
Love this app bc everything is at the finger tips!!! Allows me to place an order quickly and efficiently.
Zero communication until way after the fact and when I get to talk to them they lied and fought against the none dellivery claim for nearly 2 hours. Only after this did I by luck get someone helpful but that proved to be a red herring. Now I get apologising staff who say Uber don't aim to do but don't actually want to help. Useless 'drivers' who fake delivers and a useless company that thinks a 12 hour response time is acceptable. I got around this by going to the store and having them call.
"This app may double charge your tips, I'd check bills to be sure they're not charging extra. I was and had to prove I wasn't.. they should be able to track all this and not make it seem like were the ones in error. Bad customer service."
You guys blow chunks. Terrible interface and service.
GREAT app & the fact that u get the chance 2 see who's & the make & model of the vehicle along w/ the tracking device is AWESOME!
Sometimes its quicker to pick up the delivery yourself. On top of that I've had delivery drivers change 3 times for one delivery extending the delivery time. So don't trust the delivery estimates. Wish I could cancel my order but it will probably be cold when it arrives.
Service fee is a bit high and food always takes longer than expected only to usually arrive cold and incorrect
If you have a new number it is hell trting to get into your account if you dint recall the card used! Uber driver uber eats uber all connected so i cant use ANY of these services.
Fast and great service!! Thank you!!
Friemdly & helpful drivers
Wouldn't put through very first order😂
Good choice!
Good
Very good
"Just way too expensive, delivery takes way to long foods always cold by the time it reaches you and the fees are just beyond ridiculous."
Very convenient
Veru confusing i just downloaded it today signed in everything it's not showing me a home screen for menu i can't order just my address and a map of my area and surroundings.
punctual and reliable
Great app but customer service can be unhelpful at times.
Nice but food just dissapears sometimes
I've had orders go through multiple times when I was just viewing the cart. This has led to incomplete orders being sent and having to pay the service fee 2x due to there not being a reasonable way to cancel the order. Even if you attempt to instantly cancel an order they keep around 75% of the bill as 'compensation'.
"Serviço mau programado Esse ""serviço"" não conseguiu verificar meu CPF mesmo com várias tentativas, mesmo este estando correto e regular perante a todos os órgãos de proteção ao crédito, uma vez que nunca fiz um único crediário na vida. Eu jamais incluiria dados bancários a um serviço que eu não conheço e não confio, uma estrela é a minha esmola pra um serviço disfuncional, que se dêem por satisfeitos por não receberam uma ação civil por propaganda enganosa."
Easy and great selections.
Expensive.
Very easy to use. 😊
Bad algorithms. You delayed my food to pick up a second order and even though I'm much closer to the restaurant than the second stop you send the second order or first. That's really terrible. And if you are wondering my order number is 2A6CD.
WHY IT TAKE A FEW DAYS FOR YALL TO PUT BACK MY MONEY THAT YALL TOOK OUT OF MY ACCOUNT ??? I NEED ANSWERS CAUSE THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE !! I WORK HARD & WAIT LONG ENOUGH FOR MY MONEY FOR SOME JIVE ASS APP & OPERATORS TO TELL ME I HAVE WAIT TO GET MY MONEY BACK
I cannot consolidate my order
"They don't let you cancel or change the order in the app, unless you call support. The phone number they give you to call doesn't work, the email for support doesn't work either these people are worthless except for the drivers, they were excellent."
"Doordash is better, Grubhub too."
Great need more discounts though
Good for ordering food. Its take little time to get the food.
"Spoke too soon on my last review. I wasted $40 ordering McDonald's only to receive a cold bag of food that reeked of some strange chemical odor, and the Big Mac had been bitten into. Uber Eats did nothing about it so far. Apparently some ""specialist"" will email me back. Wasted time, money, and a potential risk to the safety of my family. Complete failure to address the situation so far. I give this app an F for how they've handled this very serious situation."
"Frustrated beyond belief! The app will not allow me to use my card, just says there's an issue with the payment. Card details are correct, even deleted them and tried again....still no joy! I called the ""helpline"" to be told they can't help me?! Suggested I used the contact option in the help section however this is not there which I explained and she told me to access it through the internet, again nothing there. Deleting this app now as it's the 5th time I've had this issue, I give up!"
Pram
superb!
Customer Service never responds and rips you off of your money. I was given 15 euros for my lost order and I tried to use it but it won't even work!!1
Good
"Asks me to rate app every time it is viewed. 2/18/20 EDIT: Every time I opened the app or ""woke up"" my phone after I set it down, I would get a pop-up asking me to rate the app. Doesn't happen anymore, so I'm increasing my rating. 3-stars because it's convenient and app is easy. However, I've made numerous orders and there are problems w/ over 50% of them. Mostly it's the restaurant's fault (the app works fine and driver's are mostly great) but food is often missing items, wrong items, or cold. 2/20/20 EDIT: In response to Uber's reply with the link: Thanks, but I have done that already. I made the issue known for each problematic order at the time I made the purchase. Sometimes the restaurant tires to make things right, sometimes not. I included it in this review not for Uber's benefit, but for potential customers who want to know about the quality of UberEats."
So far it's great. I haven't ordered in a while because the delivery charges is a little high.
Cancelaron mi pedido a último momento. No me enviaron ni siquiera un e-mail justificando por qué lo cancelaron. En el comercio dijeron que el pedido fue recogido y no supieron darme ninguna explicación.
A lifesaver. I work a lot and use it only when i dont have time to make and bring food from home!
Avoid like the plague!! Only ordered from uber eats twice and problems with both orders. The second order had half the food missing and what did arrive was cold. They have refused to send out the missing items and refused to give me a refund for them because I had problems with my first order. That's £10 of my money they have taken and not given me what I have paid for! This company should be illegal!!!
"Great app, simple to use. Waiting times varu to be honest so its not always accurate. Also disappointed about the fact that you have to spend £15 to get a discount of £10."
Best
"Péssima experiência!!! Para nunca mais!! Não baixem, é uma furada! Se acontecer alguma coisa, você não terá suporte algum para resolver! Não há número de ouvidoria, nem SAC, nem nada que possa te dar um respaldo. Os atendentes dos pedidos não sabem solucionar os problemas; te mandam conversar por email com um local chamado ""suporte"", que são simplesmente robôs do ""cópia e cola"", te mandam mensagens copiadas e não resolvem o problema de ninguém! Não existe suporte algum!"
Ok from Oklahoma
"I miss the northern states in which you can pick up the phone and actually order with no service fee, no lack of menu information and just overall easy. This app sucks!!!!!"
Great
Good
Excellent Service 👌🏻
This app works great in Tampico. I have ordered many times before and food always get in time. Delivery service is quite fast and well wrapped.
Broken user interface resulted in the take away giving us the wrong items and customer support were very dismissive of our issue. Will continue to use JustEat in the future.
Always get here
yay
"First order never arrived and no support was available at all except for obvious faq. Worst delivery experience had to date. waiting for someone to contact me and get a refund. Edit: Got the refund automatically, still really bad experience."
"Cold food, no customer service, try to always shift blame to restaurants. Never treat customers with respect. Left them for good now. Terrible idea using them at all."
Excellent
"Me dice que mi numero ya esta registrado cuando es la primera vez que uso ,la app no tiene otra opcion que poner el numero y no puedo dar aviso de este error, horrible experiencia no la recomiendo."
"Loving it. Gaining too much weight, lol"
Terrible
Worst app worst customer service infact its kind a scam
GOOD
Absolutely horrible service. Why do you take an order when you don't have enough delivery people? Waited 2 hours for my food and when I contact customer service they asked me to wait as they are trying to assign a delivery person. After 2 hours. Pathetic. This was the last time I ordered with you.
Great Service 👍
Great
"Really good, I just wish that the special offer countdown was 10 minutes not 5, it makes picking items stressful"
Crappy and useless app.
You guys say I can't use the live chat option because I need to update the app but I am using the latest version but now I can't get urgent help because of this live chat thing. Fix that!
A couple weeks ago this app was very incosistant (orders going through but no one to pick up/ taking over an hour for a food place 15min away from my work) but within the last 2 weeks they have been more on top of it or at least showing that they were unavailable/ short on drivers or overloaded with orders. I'd rather open the app and see its unavailable then order something and an hour later have it be canceled without a reason.
My experience with this app is just super awesome
Great app
Horrible app. I ordered 5 times from them and got a delivery 2 times out of 5. Canceled my order 3 times and never told me why or even called to let me know it was canceled. Will never download this app.
This is so hit and miss most of the time its been great but the past 3 times ive had a problem with my order or something missing and they just dont care they never get back to you its silly ive rang up the company to be told by a machine to email them with ny issues then hung up on so disappointed as it started out so good. Ok so 2 of my orders from mcdonalds have had a total of 5 items missing one time turning up with the sauce for the item but no item how is that possible Cant type more max
Great!
Good
Sweet app
Works well. Love the partners. Yummy food.
Ubereats not that great you will spend your money and they will never give it back to you always excuses they always mess up never give a refund so before you download this go somewhere else this company does not care about you or how do you spend your money with them once it's in their hands they look at the customers like they're crazy and no refund after my child ate a raw chicken sandwich from Popeyes so please let this be a lesson learned stop using Uber eats they not care about thecustomer
Easy to use. :)
Most of the time my orders are on time and exactly how I have ordered from the app. A few times I have had missing items on my orders.
Good
great
Love the app. But the restaurants need to be on their driver's more.
Worst application ever seen in life
Fast Deliver
In one word Great!
HAGAN LO QUE HAGAN NO LA DESCARGUEN! Revisen su reputación en Facebook. Hay muchas quejas que deben ver antes de animarse a utilizar su servicio. Utilicen cualquier otra alternativa de courier/delivery presente en su país.
Good
Food never arrived and uber took hours to get back to me... at the moment still no food and no offer of a refund!
Not easy to use app
My very first order was delayed by an hour before I cancelled it and then I was charged for cancelling the order even though it was an hour late. Pretty disappointing for a first customer.
Always spot on
Fast
Please come back uber eats .. we fedup with Zomato and swiggy .. they are looting us with taxes and charges
"its a great app, but it gave me the wrong order"
The missing items from your orders will never arrive or be reimbursed. They'll happily ignore your requests and complaints while taking your money for things they never sent. Absolute rip-off. Complete con. Avoid at all costs.
I wish there was an option for a zero star. Absolutely awful customer service! They are apparently only able to recite predetermined sentences and not help you at all with issues you might encounter. Not going to use it again
Love them quick and fast
So good
Amazing i order everyday lol
Driver couldnt speak english and told me he couldnt understand written english either so order was cancelled by driver. Then I got a warning message saying I will be charged for future no shows would not recommend as in this case customers are not taken care of
Very fast delivery excellent service
"All is great, new restaurants popping up on a daily basis. Now...Uber Eats...you are double dipping with the delivery fee and service fee...take a pick. I'm fine with one, both its a bit too much...considering a person like my self alwasy likes to tip the driver."
"Absolute garbage. I used this app for the first time today and placed my order 2 hours ago. It's stuck ""preparing order"". I feel like the are holding my money hostage because if I try to cancel they are going to charge me 33$! My order was 46$."
As uber eats is taken over by Zomato then what is the use of this app?? It redirects to Zomato itself...
Simple and easy to use
Horrible. Cancelled my order and they charged me the full fee. Disgusting !
"Bad at issuing refunds when the restaurant has the order ready and they don't have any drivers, then order arrives COLD or ALWAYS MISSING AN ITEM!"
Tasty
On time and prelight
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. FIRST TIME ORDERING AND THE DRIVER THREW AROUND MY FOOD IT WAS SO SLOPPY
Great easy app
"Orders from 30 minutes away, rip off... they forget food everytime and u can't cancel if they take 3 hours... horrible support and horrible deliveries"
It is a good app but as we say every thing has a flaw. It's rate's are super high if not for anyone sorry but it's high for me.
Good service
Good
GPS directions are never correct. Drivers are never close when it tells them they arrived.
Don't sell Uber eats to Zomato...plzzz...enable it in India...we love Uber eats
They deliver in time💞
Very easy
Good
It only show expensive restaurants!
Good food app:)
Biggest offer for negombo people
Easy to use and great UI
I miss uber eats....i used to order everytime with this app bt nw wen ever i open Uber eats zomato app v ll open...
"Absolutely diabolical service drivers cant find address and are completely rude then dont deliver food , hard to make a complaint or contact anyone for a refund,you ring the number to complain and told you cant do that over the phone and have to go online and email do that and you get a response saying they havent received your complaint , will never use agian"
If you are re directing again to Zomato whats the point in keeping this app again in playstore when zomato app is already present.
I like the convinience. I love uberEats shem!
Faul app There is no option to cancel Call center behavior is not well enough
Nice app
Sometimes dont load correctly
"Worst service ever, driver vadim rang with a horrible attitude then did not deliver at all I rang driver back to see where he was he hung up on me then posted on the app he had delivered will never use this service again, had to give 1 star as they dont have lower. I am deleting the app as I am disgusted with the service 😡"
"Great little app! I use it nearly every time I am working onsite. Great for pickup or delivery. One wish. I'm often offering for pickup at the stop light (not while driving). I always order the same thing, but I have to put in the add-ons every time. It would be so handy to have this as a ""one click"" order and just be able to press a button and have the custom order go through on the default payment, maybe with one confirmation summary with total."
Worst experience ever. Everytime I ordered food they over charged me and wouldn't refund me for ages. I had to spend so much time taking pictures of how I had been over charged and I got nothing in return for their mistakes. Horrible customer service and do not rate them at all. Have to give a minimum of one star.
Very bad they try to steal me money I'm very disappointed
Best and Fast Delivery!
Fast friendly service
Great support as well. Since theres tons of delivery apps already. The edge will always be support as it is the only thing left not based in an algorithm
Good
"I've signed up to be an uber eats driver, with the app only opening after each 24 hours, very inconsistent operation"
Excellent 👍
Disgusting service. They take money off your account and refuse to help you.
"one of my friend in office just order burgers, worst burger of my life and we dispute on yhat but no response worst order food online app."
Doesn't even open.
Some of their driver take my order and i was pay online so my order and my money has been stolen
Amazing!
I think its shocking how an uber driver doesnt know the local area now we are starving
Good App. Easy to navigate.
20 mins late and they screwed up my order
Uber eats not available now
"Great app, but can get expensive"
They don't respond to complaints! I have had to send my complaint twice with no response!
Excellent
One of the best apps I have ever used.
Good
Super
Awesome

Worst app it's show your account doesn't have password I have used it early but it is showing such a worst app
Great prices and service
Nice
Just sent a text plus 45 minutes ago to uber support on twitter asking for help and I still havent gotten a response. Other problems being with uber rides specifically.
Nice service
"Somebody tried to log into my account. I got an email about a pw reset I hadn't requested I changed my pw & tried to log all devices out of my Uber account but there's no option for that so I asked Uber to log my account out of all devices. I've been told, via email, on 7 occasions, that Uber has logged me out of all devices. But they are lying. I'm still logged in everywhere & they just send me the same email. I can't put payment info back until they do this & it looks like they never will."
Good
Very user friendly and accurate
"I just missed the phone call for a sec because I was taking another call, and the deliver cancelled my order? you kidding me?"
Thank you four your service.
poor services plus not worth it they dont consider clients promo
Nightmare trying to order on here
It says that i have a account but I have never been on this app ever so I don't know what to do next rubbish
"First time use, food was delivered quickly and hot.. all was correct and very yummy.. thankyou"
We want uber eats back in india plzz zomato is wAste
Great
Гениально. Если нет аккаунта в убере то в приложении нигде нет возможности это сделать или получить ссылку
Great way to eat!
Third time this week trying to order from this app and keep getting my order cancel. I spoke to a rep twice this week. Yesterday and on Monday and they don't know this is happening. I thought maybe they had an update. So I updated it and tried again today. Just to get the same cancel my order. This is very frustrating and no one from the company knows why this happening. I'm not the only one going through this.
No problems so far 👌👍🏻😊
Incorrect selection of default location threw me off. It cost me money unnecessarily.
I cant use the app at all please fix my issue expired link
Exceptional performance from all the delivery drivers
"More and more fees (delivery fees, service fees), less and less quality service (making more than one delivery at once, so the food delivered is no longer in good temperature). I'm rating it 2 stars and starts thinking of deleting the app for good... Edit 20th Feb : Following your poor answer which is clearly generic and does not answer my review, I'm uninstalling the app after 5 years of very recurrent usage. You clearly don't care about customer satisfaction."
Awfull
Very faster
Great
"How trustworthy are your uber eats drivers? I've ordered but did not received my order and on my app it said that my order was delivered. Tried returning the uber eats number which I received as missed call but it said I cant contact that number. There's no contact number of the driver too, so now what should I do? Who yo call? You got my money, but I did not received my food!!!!!!"
Excellent idea. You guys are going to make a killing!
"Fanominal, keep the deals coming"
❤ love the app!
I have a issues When i am entering the number it saying your account doesnt have a password
Great stuff for my lazy ass
Great service
I have from forgot my password my email address so what to do to login in this app
Very useful apk
Unreal
"So disappointed with my experience tonight- I was so hungry that I tracked my order the whole time. I received the wrong order and reported it in the app. I received no response, so I took the food back to the restaurant and explained to the cashier what happened. The restaurant never even received my order from Uber Eats! I had to order and pay for it again. Now, after calling Uber Eats, I get to wait 3-5 days for a refund. There are not enough characters to express how inconvenient this was!"
Can't register my email during registration because i have used the same email on uber ride app. We can't open many emails because of apps. Make it to accept both uber travel app and uber eats
"I've been using Uber for rides for years, but I didn't try Uber Eats until last week. I ordered from Burger King but it was canceled because they couldn't find a driver. I just ordered from Steak 'n Shake, but it was canceled because they couldn't find a driver. I'll stick with Doordash."
Great
worst food app ever. the other apps are giving food in so much lesser than you guys. i've ordered a delivery and it was the worsest experience ever. never gonna order again.
Support is a joke and I don't know if the drivers can see deliver notes
Why does it tell me to use Zomato when I have downloaded Uber eats. If Zomato has acquired Uber eats then just remove this app from the playstore rather than just making people download this app and make an account and then redirecting them to download Zomato and use it to order food. it's just a waste of time
Love this app!!
Awful. They deliver only to certain areas.
This app cannot add my exact location. If you can upgrade app to select locations on tha map please
Very nice meals
Doesn't work anymore. I have to manually enter my address and the app won't find any address I enter. There is an error message about not being able to find any location data. Uninstalling the app
If I am not wrong UBER EATS has been acquired by ZOMATO then this app should not be available on play store. As I tried to order food from uber app which is also used to book cab.
Really helpful app
Nice
"They just cancelled the order after me waiting for an hour. They justify it by saying there was an issue and the money was refunded! They just don't realise that the issue is we waited for an hour hungry to have lunch and they just cancelled. Their support is pathetic too. Trust me.. Find other food delivery options..there are many around. Uber responded asking me to refer to a link, which I had already done earlier. They just responded saying they had some difficulty and returned my money."
"Uber eats hasn't resolved the issue of a wrongly charged amount and outstanding balance is still visible in my account. With regards to this I had already emailed uber support on 11/01/2019.It's because inspite of me mentioning the address & location clearly on map,the rider kept on calling me(illogically) to ask my location and when I couldn't pick up phone, he cancelled my order without even reaching the location and when I called back he refused to deliver. He didn't even return it to hotel."
Good response to support issues. You can get a refund when wrong food is delivered.
I was looking for a simple delivery app for some food while at work one day. There's no way I'm paying almost triple price for what I already know. I'd rather not eat.
delete this app from play store ⁸
singed up a few days back and I didn't even apply my 50% and the app says I've already applied the promotion 🤷‍♂️ thanks Uber 👍
I tasted the food its delicious
Good
"It's the 3rd time that my delivery have been delayed over an hour. You guys need to do something about this, and please, do not allow people in bicycles to do deliveries!!! Hopefully this gets fixed so I can give a 5 star review."
It's decent
Getting more and more expensive with no guarantee.....
"Great selection of foods/drinks, though. Ot the apps fault but some vendors charge more for their products than going there in person."
Terrible app. Tells me restaurants are unavailable when they are clearly open and I've ordered from them before.
Unable to login.... It says my mobile number is not associated with my email id
"Great, Don't break our trust by overpriced"
Great service
"Why does it says ""whoops we couldn't complete your order""? Totally nonsense."
👍
They're great
"Superb app,.."
Very nice
Having to wait a long time to get order because driver is far away and had another order. This is happening alot lately and its terrible customer Service. Delivery lady very nice food is good jmif they have 2 orders someone will NOT get the order on time which defeats the whole point of paying fees and tips to uber eats and not going to get it myself.
Very bad application . I had a trouble with arestuarant suggested by uber eats . The food was horrible and they didn't help .
"Y'all making it so easy to waste my money. For the 10 mins after it arrives, it's worth it though."
Pretty good wish it had more selections like wing stop lol
Ok app sometimes sets ur address to wrong address which can cause issues with drivers and available stores
"I had a few good experiences with the app, but one bad experience ruined it all. I waited three hours for a delivery and had no way to contact the driver or the Customer Service. The phone number needs to be somewhere accessible. When I reached out to Uber Eats, their only solution was to cancel the order and assure me I wouldn't be charged. This screams of a half measure. No compensation was offered at any point."
"Never any drivers, takes order before checking if they can even deliver it."
Always have issues that they dont want yo seem to try to help you with never listen to true issues
Great
"Convenient, but expensive for food delivery and I have had multiple issues with wrong orders and being charged for orders that never arrived. Also, i most recently I had to deal with a situation where I was sent identical double orders and was charged the matching double charge for an order that I only ordered once. Over all not extremely happy and I am going to uninstall the app regardless of the convenience. Looks like I'm going to start being less lazy and actually drive to pick up my food."
Good .... could be better jus like everything else.
"I love that they give you 4 separate discounts for new users. It honestly suprised me, considering that most delivery apps dont give that many upfront"
"I love it. Lots of people say, ohhh its expensive. But I say hey its delivery for a few extra bucks and tip can't go wrong. Awesomeness"
The charges are a bit high
Live uber eats very reliable
Its miss leading. I think it is absolutely wrong that the Uber drivers will pick up multiple orders and deliver them all along the way. This is hot food that should come straight from the restaurant my house. No where is there a setting to not let this happen. Bad business Urber. I will use another service from now on.
Very nice!👍🏿
"App suddenly stopped working and can't get to the help menu, couldn't find a help button on the site and the email just gave me automatic response telling me to use the app."
"Good experience very professional,"
This app is life
"Can't delete credit card because app doesn't properly support phones with screen cutouts. Edit: This doesn't help with deleting the payment method, because the option is positioned too high on my Galaxy s10 and can't be selected"
"One night i ordered subway. App said driver was almost here, then they canceled my order. I think a driver stole the food. Tried calling subway and nobody answered."
"Pretty rare that the restaurants listed are near enough for delivery since I'm outside city limits. Also, this app has delivered things to an address 10 miles away. Twice. I guess it's my bad for thinking that GPS and me typing my address could enough"
If there are problems with the order there's nobody to contact. I get a generic questionnaire and nobody replies back. And my money is just taken and I don't get my products.
Horrible bad get noob
"Good promotions eg occasional free delivery. When its not free though, i prefer when there was a flat fee of $5, some places charge way too much."
"Tried several times to use app to order food. Kept seeing ""error fetching location results"". Uninstalled then reinstalled app; still didn't work. Attempted to make a report through chat, but was rerouted to another page requesting my credit card and other information. Why would I have to pay for YOU to fix a problem with your app? Of course, I didn't and wouldn't give out my information. What is going on?"
Drivers cancel alot. Not as reliable as normal Uber
The fees are too much😮
We miss you in India. Please come back !
Gay automatic bank charges
Terrible give me the meal wrong an refused refunds an had this done to me quite few times
Good
Really good
No way to reach out to a person or contact customer service via phone.
I cant order after 10pm
La instale y me sale que no están disponibles en el momento
Food drunk at 9amq
Dey ok. If you like food and all. Dont try and order hookers tho.
Good
It works well but support needs work.
"O app marcou meu pedido como entregue sem eu receber ele, esta muito atrasado e até agora nada"
Reliable and convenient
I had nun but good expierence
Dosent do ubereats where I live
Annoying how the app doesn't automatically change to your location like any of the other delivery apps
Incrível
👍👍👍
"Fast delivery, great service."
Quick and easy app!
My first order with uber eats and 3 items were missing in my order will be uninstalling the app..
AWESOME
So good n lovely
Ta bien duro pq no tengo que salir d casa y tengo mas tiempo pa jugar play4 y darme una caaqueta
There needs to be a way to contavt the driver BEFORE they pick up your food - not just after. ALSP there needs to be a way to contact someone at Uber when there are app failures or bugs.
Amazing and exceptional service 💯❤️ I work in a large hospital and they still deliver promptly 😁 thank you!
Good
The support team is kinda rude
Ordered from a chain restaurant. Eta was an hour or so. That fine. Kept getting delayed eventually by almost an hour extra. Sitting on can't find a driver. Cancelling would still charge because the food was already made... So I'm just waiting for cold food? At some point my order is cancelled and the restaurant becomes listed as unavailable on the app. Will not use this service again.
Can't even sign up for an account.
"Very bad experiences they charged me twice for order cancelled twice leaving me without money, because of that i couldn't order anymore food"
"Always increasing the mystery ""service fee"" plus and additional ""delivery fee"" uber is getting extremely greedy with the fees. Will stop using service. Not worth the additional charges."
Loving the on time service
I have entered my address twice but no luck
"Opens and asks for delivery address, but when I search it never loads... Got a response from customer service to clear app cache. Have done so, does not fix issue."
"No cancel option once you accidentally press the accept button. Even you want to cancel the order or they fail to provide the food to you, they will charge you no matter what."
Basically unusable now. Crashes every time. Terrible app after recent updates. Deleted & reinstalled. More stable but still flakey.
Not bad
Love
Great
"I keep traveling all the time and have found uber eats convenient many times, until i had issues. They charge you for an order, tracker shows the time, and preparing for delivery status, but food Never arrives.. They simply want to take the money,but not the responsibility. Don't suggest this app to anybody.the only response you get from the help center is a fake apology and a message that says they won't be able to refund the money for you. Its so frustrating"
Super fast and efficient
Very bad service waste time and money. Unfortunately it looks like drivers don't want to pick up your orders anymore if you don't tip them from beginning not after the service. 3 hours I have been waiting for my order. What a joke. Just for the update I wrote a complaint email but ofcourse noone bother to write me back.
"Can't find ""refer a friend button"""
Good app. Has most resturants in the area. Makes it easy to order food. Glad you also can see who's bringing your food.
Wont let me create a new account or log in because the email associated with my number is no longer my email so i have absolutely no way of using the app.. fix this problem.
Great
Good.
"Order was cancelled after two hours wait at 9:00 PM on valitines day. No attempt was made to contact me. Support was difficult to reach, slow to respond, offer generic responses and refused to offer a credit the account. Uninstalling this app and sticking to seemless which has never failed to immediately respond and issue a credit whenever an issue arose."
Horrible service. Too many fees
I like the application
Very good
"No issues, good app and somewhat less buggy than other apps for a similar service."
They automatically charged R50 per month Eats Pass. It took me three months to get a credit. I uninstalled the Eats App forever.
Good
Does what it says on the tin 👍🏾
Not able to change delivery address
Not allowing me to place order or change add account
It is a useful app.
my
Sometimes items gose unavilable and never come back And sometimes they delete alot of very good restaurants
Not bad
Awful didn't have the option to log in and when I tried signing my partner up it would t let me put his name in your lucky u got 1 star 👎
Bad
"Can't access resteraunts. It won't let me browse resteraunts after I have entered my address, and I got stuck on that page."
"Highly recommend, great to use"
"Terrible app, not working."
Great app
Usually amazing. Sometimes courier time quotes are wrong. Sometimes they pair to bike courier when restaurant is too far away. 90% solid use though.
Amazing
Easy to use and great selection with low delivery fees
"Great free delivery offers, much better than just eat which don't do that"
Fast delivery
I was surprised to see a $2.00 small order fee. I think this should have been more evident.
Brilliant
App dont open only show delivery details
"I honestly dont normally leave reviews on apps but I had to with this one. I was using door dash before and thought they were pretty good but I LOVE UBER EATS. It is so much faster and delivery fees are much lower, there are options if multiple restaurants are within delivery distance. You can actually track the order and see how close the driver is instead of the rough timing estimate on door dash. 10/10 recommend if you want a simple and easy delivery app"
Excellent
I always get my meal on time
Brilliant experience. Just delivery price should lower considering that food prices are slightly higher than at the shop
Always works as it's supposed too
Poor poor poor
"Fast, easy, more options."
You shouldn't force us to tip a driver before the delivery is made. I want to base my tip on the level of service I get.
Fantastic 🤤
Great
Really bad waited over an hour and then had order canceled...all on the first time use
I cannot open the app since i forgot my password. Moreover even though i reset a new password i cannot log in to the app.
Pretty good
Its ideal
Great
Support when a restaurant fks up is complete trash
Not much restaurant selections
Perfect
"The best app in its category,most important feature i like is u can apply promo on COD also."
Late and cold
Goooood
Used 4 times so far due to my child stay in the heath hospital only once let down but that was sorted out very fast
Its worst app
Good job. Well done
Very good app
Easy way to eat great foods you've never tried
Get back.
Was double charged for an order. Called to correct it. They are saying they will not refund the money for order I did not receive. So I paid for food I did not get to enjoy. Thanks uber eats. I will be going back to dor dash.
Therealrockyhes love uber eats
"The map that tracks your food needs an upgrade, (too small, & blocked by other content) but the app itself is great"
Great App for food delivery
App doesn't function
Superb precise timing. Loved it!
Why app is sayin go to Zomato? It was really beautiful UI app now it's not available.
Perfect♡
Uber its tharus airuchu
Great service
I couldn't sign in to uber eats using the mobile number since it shows as your account does not have password
Great
"Effortlessly simple, a good selection of options and menu choices. Easily navigated and quick to use again and again."
Unable to download this app...
Love it🥰🥰🥰🥰
Most expensive delivery on the market yet totally unacceptable service. Order gets delivered to someone else more often than not with basically no way to get in touch with customer support.
I like uber
I can't log into my account! It says something went wrong 😑
Pretty good. Much much better than glovo
"I have forgotten my password, tried to reset but does not recognise my email."
Works well. Easy to use
"Can't even set it up as ""email address in use"" well that's the email I want to use and it's mine, never even used it, I'm not setting up another for the app."
"Everytime I used it, it's worked great. Live support line works also in real time. Recommend."
A life save when u need mergency food to satisfy your cravings
Changed my opinion from 5 stars to 3. The delivery fee of 59kr is way to expensive.
Amaizing app with great offers
Launch a lighter app
Wonder full
Amazing
Good
Sooo goood
Fantastique services ever
Always professional deliveries and easy to navigate thru the site.
Awesome and convenient
Absolutely amazing
Easy to use
Good app. Vert helpful
I can't use the app in Perth Australia when I search for fast food it goes to MacDonald Tokyo Japan where I was the last time I used it I tried your help page but can't find nothing about this problem and my GPS is working good I tried cleaning the cache data and installed on a different device but still the same still in Japan http//help.uber/eaters is not useful on this subject
"When it works well it's great. However my biggest gripe is the ETA. You can't have an ETA and just keep adding a minute to it while it hasn't arrived. Like, why have a been waiting 20 minutes watching my ETA increase by a minute for every minute that passes. I get that there are some things that are out of their control, but this is a bit ridiculous"
"I really like this app, my food is always delivered in a timely fashion. The only problem I have with this app is that they are missing 1 or 2 items from certain places, the only one I can think of now is one of the subs at subway is missing but available in a wrap but overall a great app"
RIP
Why i can't even log in?!!
"I used to have it on my other phone when I went to put on new phone says email not registered with password which it is ,but no option to create new account ?"
Nice app
"Love it, can now have my favourite rock and chips delivered. Along with any other food I or m grandson fancy."
Reliable and safe
"No customer support capabilities on the app. No customer support phone number listed on the app. Google results end up showing a disconnected customer support line. Finally scrolled down for the new number. Yeah, all outsourced now in INCREDIBLY broken English. I know it's the way of the world now but man... Very hard to communicate due to that barrier!"
"Terrible customer service. Theres a hidden hold charge that gets stolen from you and it's difficult to get back. My bank is in the red because of this, the agent on live chat was not helpful and didnt seem to care."
It doesn't accept a card payment
Rubbish
Spot on every time
Why I cannot login back again?
"Servizio orrendo, uber adifferenza di justeat non ha un servizio di assistenza, dal loro sito vi risponderanno solo bot che ovviamente non comprenderanno il problema. Risultato? Ho buttato via tempo e denaro"
Fantastic
Absolutely love it. Even though sometimes the delivery takes longer then the estimated latest delivery but that's only for a few restaurants.
Use useless drivers who deliver cold food. The guy couldnt follow a gps and went to 3 different locations. And called for directions constantly. He didnt read extra instructions and delivered cold food. So I did not accept it. I informed UBER eats who said they cant do anything about this and they are just a 3rd party app. They wont give refund or credit. Useless app. dont bother. Plus now I am trying to delete my account but there is no way to delete it. Or my credit card details.
All food delivery apps suck unless you live in medium to large city. This one just happens to be the most expensive one.
Not very happy with the selection and their driver tracking is worse than useless. It all used to be better but a number of restaurants I was interested in trying suddely disappeared off the app and I'm done standing outside for 20 minutes as I watch my driver do donuts in the middle of the ocean or drive in reverse through Cape Town Edit: UberEats asked me to respond to their helpdesk with more information but tonight's order started with delivery by 9:50 before correcting to 10:20 then 10:40
"easy to order, food still hot when arrive..thanks you!"
Good
As soon as my two week uber eats pass was over and I was charged the 9.99 my app stopped working. It says error fetching search location results.and I cant do anything in the app. I cant even ask for help. I emailed the email address provided in the app store and it says this is not a monitored email address.
We love using Uber Eats BUT there needs to be a way for CUSTOMERS to get ahold of CUSTOMER Service!
"Ubereats is not that bad. If something happens, they can refund you and usually will. However, when something bad happens (order unfulfilled, etc.), the experience is terrible. It sucks when you're ubereats driver doesnt deliver your order and youre hungry as hell. It sucks when you're supposed to be studying and eating but you are wasting yor time writing an angry review. Ubereats isnt the worst thing in the world. But it can definitely do better."
I can't download this app
Excellent app
Poor customer service
Great app to use
Drop your delivery charge would be nice
"The app is good, but does not allow for one to change their address on time before pick up when the order has already been placed."
Expensive sometimes
It's easier to go out and organise your own food.
"Driver did not contact upon arrival, I specifically put meet driver at car as they never seem to manage to walk to the unit & just cancel...so I made it easier for them, they cancelled without even contacting. My phone was being kept free to ensure contact wouldn't be missed!!! Thanks for keeping my money & failing to bring my son his dinner! I'll always use other providers now."
Worst now to zomato
Good
"App was good.. But they are showing me balance in my account,, whereas i have already paid to the delivery guy"
Very easy to use!
F-ing love it
Works until 2 am I am less than .3 miles from 24hr mcds. They couldn't get my order from 2 to 5 with ordering the same thing. Watched car get to parking lot 3 different times but they couldn't deliver Other than that it works in semi normal business hrs. Says it's otw and driver rolls with food when finally making it to street. I have no issue wh en ordering anywhere but mcds
Quick and perfect. Just need to add more restaurants to the list
"Timely Delivery! Quick ordering process! Drivers are always professional, courteous, and ensure the food is delivered!!! I appreciate this APP and service!"
Im Lazy so this works
cannot find live chat. applying credit also doesnt work
Not happytold to meet said at door also asked home alone is this policy
When I open app always asks me for open zomato alwaysssss
Limited restaurant choices.
Obviously a great service but the app crashes constantly on my android phone.
Good
I can't log in i have never used it before and i can't sign up and they keep telling me to log in how will i login in when i never created an account here before.
"The app is almost flawless, except the fees! They charge £3.50 for restaurants that are minutes away, yet £2.50 for some further away. Someone definitely needs to check these! Also the pin in the map cannot be moved when they place it in the wrong location."
Great service thank you************************good app
"Did the £15 for a friend promo, friend got no £15 off and the £15 off for me hasn't worked and the support people aren't fixing it or replying for over 12 hours. It's been days now. They have effectively conned us out of £20 & not given back what they advertised. Will you use Just Eat only after this. They reply below saying contact the same people who aren't helping for 6 days. They conned my friend out of £20 & my free £15 off doesn't work. Don't use uber eats £15 off for a friend promo."
Looted customers always...
Uber vouchers and gift cards are a scam. You still have to pay and then hope they refund you.
If Uber eats is been acquired by zomato why are you still having this app on play store. After installing and registration over this app it redirects to zomato and that app needs to be downloaded. Do what is the point in installing Uber eats when you don't give service.
First time ordering from Bellas and the food was great highly recommend their fish and chips 5 stars..Christine.
Delicious app❤️😋
Excellent
"Worst app ever. Information restriction, changing the information on orders without notice, this app has it all to disappoint you, not even subtly. Go get your food yourself or order from restaurants with actual delivery personel.. Response to Developer feedback as there isn't anothway to write: I used the app twice and uninstalled it everytime. Delivery fees (%30) of order, crazy delays and no compensation,delivery personnel late simply changes the time of delivery without notice,cartel logic"
Wont allow me to sign in with my new number and email...
Love Uber eats
Could never get into this app and when I sent a email explaining I could never get into it. No one would respond. Never used!
Delivery drivers have not picked up orders on numerous occasions
Osama
"It didn't open and when it opened it asked me to visit zomato, completely useless app"
Easy to use
Awesome 🤩
M not able to. Open it 🙄🙄🙄such a ridiculous app this is again n again it is showing mail isn't associated with ur number despite everything is ok
No. 1 nice promotions
Happy New year and thanks for your email bye for now so much for the email and the other one you have been working on the welcome back for tomorrow night 🌃 it is a bit of a 7 for 6 and 5 f7d7g
Good
Is there a way to edit your address or delete addresses?
"Hi Uber team, I ordered food for 800rs on 20/01/2020 and payment was made through my card. Restaurant cancelled my order. But amount not refunded. This happened exactly one day before uber became Zomato. I visited help.uber web and raised more than 2 tickets but no response. I checked my uber app and the refund is not updated in that wallet. It would be really great, if you can reach me and let me know how to get refund of my money. The Order I'd is F1493. Regards, Vijay. A"
Not much variety of restaurants
Very Good Service
"Hey I can't use ubereats , it's redirecting to Zomato."
Tonight was my first order through Uber Eats. It was a freaking nightmare. The restaurant didn't know how to call Uber Eats dispatch two separate drivers for an order that could not be picked up because the restaurant was closed. Actually had to call another chain restaurant under the same franchise to have them do this properly
My delivery is super late and they offered me a discount on my next one as opposed to this one
Everthing perfect bout this app
Super easy to use. 1. Drink tons of alcohol. 2. Order uber eats!!!!
What? . I get 90% of my request
What a joke. We ordered through uber eats for the first time and it will be our last! First driver didnt show to pick up our food so the 2nd driver showed up to get it and the waitress said it was sitting on the counter for 40 minutes. The food got to us and it was cold and soggy. Not to mention we live less then three miles from the restaurant so there is no reason for the food to be so late. I dont blame the restaurant I blame Uber Eats.
Expinsesive
Waste of time
Amazing app and good food with fast delivery
Such a nice app it was we will miss it
Very very fast
"There's always Epping something with this damn app we go to order food. Just wasted $40 because they say I have a past due balance, which I don't."
Great service
"Every time I order, I have either missing food, wrong food, and soft soggy food. The reason I gave them 3 stars is because the customer service is decent"
Good
Omg it was nut in my food 😥😥
"Hell to use.. Always crash and has ""unknown error"" notice everytime"
"App is fine. Problem is it tells me the restaurant had requested for more time while delaying my order for an hour... 15 minutes at a time. While my food sits ready at the restaurant (I know because I called) the problem was actually they had no drivers... I tried to cancel and couldn't get a chance to cancel... Can't complain, no customer service... Insanity. Worst customer service possible."
Half the time they can't find a driver for an order. The other half they find a driver half an hour late and your food is cold by the time you get it. You can't even get a refund because at that point it's passed their five minute requirement for cancellations. I do not recommend.
Uber eats has been cancelling my order for no reason just outside my house
I can't even use the Uber eats app. It won't show anything. All it says is delivery address. When I put in delivery address it don't do anything either. Fix this please
"Forced me to do tip even though I put zero on there, should not force tip without telling me."
Great app
Worst App not operating in India.
Thanks to the driver for a great delivery 😊
User Friendly and sophisticated.
They give you one price then change it after
Garbage I recieved 1 out of 4 orders after waiting 1 hr or more after the deliver time
It is glitchy sometimes and gave to re enter the order. Some restaurants don't follow the instructions you leave them.
The food was late and completely wrong.
Awsome
"One can't add notes or allergies yo the order, plus it doesn't let you edit your bill in case you need to add more tip. Tip should be allow to add after delivery received, not before. Delivery fee too high."
I would like to delete my whole account including personal information as address name telephone number and card numbers if I have been banned you have no reason to be keeping my personal information I would like my account to be deleted all together it should not be any of my information in your f****** serviceso I need to know how to delete my account not cancel I'm saying delete so that means all of my personal information would not be on this company site whatsoever you got banned my card Sa
"Es muy mala, siempre la app tiene errores de carga y ademas me dio una cobro supuestamente anterior que jamás acepté"
Since August last year my order was cancelled. I'm STILL waiting for the refund
Problemas y Problemas
Love this one.
So convenient
Cool
"Removed two stars. App keeps asking me to rate it since I got a new phone. Agree and it takes me to this screen, then it doesn't register that I already rated it and asks me again. Fix this bug."
"Easy to use, caters to tastes, and has excellent promotions"
Excellent
Need a stop point to ask user to check Delivery Address where a user specificallyhas to verify address!!!!!! I travel a lot and order at the office and hotel and so many times I forget to change the address and the address change process is TERRIBLE
Quick delivery
"not worth the hassle. Edit. Yes why is a delivery that used to be advertised around 7.99 now says its 4.99 but with an additional fee of 4.78 coming up to just under 10? Somehow it just keeps getting worse over time with even more overbloated charges that quite frankly cannot be justified. Pick out an order around 17 and change, expect to pay at least 26 if you dont tip."
great apps
"I can only say that the log in method is poorly designed. If you lose your previous number then you can't access your account anymore, no matter if everything else stays the same."
This is why I have credit card payments to make lmao
Lovely lady. 5 stars
I love this app so much!!! For work reason a didn't have time to make a proper meal and with Uber eat that's possible!!!😊
Too easy to use. Lol. I should go out and see the world more but this app let's us stay home and alone. Ha.
Do This App Take Cash.
Easy and convenient
Great app. Better than ifood
"Amazing, who can.say no to free food?"
Slow and very laggy
"Só trava, os códigos promocionais não funcionam 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️"
There is no way to contact a person when there's an issue
"Really? What is wrong with this app? I was in contact with my driver and I asked if he could cancel the order. I got a notification saying 'Your Deliver Was Attempted' on the phone he said he was at the restaurant and noticed that the delivery was to a military base, that's when I told him if he can cancel. He said he did and it still showed him on the map as the delivery driver. Now I didn't get a refund, did I just get scammed from this uber eats app?"
The original and the best!!! Mistakes are inevitable but these guys are very professional in handling such mistakes....unlike skip the dishes Who are very cheap and unprofessional.uber eats is where its at.i only have one food app on my phone.dont get fooled by promotions from other apps they dont back it up with thorough customer service.
Data collector app. Wanted to make an order with cash payment and needed to: * Make an account * Add phone number * Add an email and verify it * Verify by credit card or PayPal or by Facebook O do not see a reason for most of this data. Won't ever use it!
I love it. If you feel like a salad or maccas you can get it if you want it is so useful.
I used this morning at 4:30am the gentleman that answered the phone was very nice _ polite & when i talked to tje friver herbert he was also very very polite my food arrived quickly with no.problem like i had been having with grubhub & door dash both i had problems over & over it made my morning i ordered at 4:25 & i had my food at 5: o6am & the food was still nice & hot i was so impressed that that i called & added a bigger tip i plan on ordering again this evening & i hope i have kust as m
🦊
The person delivering couldn't even find the address. Had to walk in the cold to find them....
I really love this app it's great
My husband is a truck driver. So this is an amazing service when we are stuck for hours at a pick up or drop.
Better offers and discounts than its competitors but still needs improvement and to include more restaurants.
It is amazing! Plus it motivated me to do Uber Eats as a side job!
good with the 5 min free delivery promotion.
Great service food is always fresh n hot n on time.
great
Well developed for all my needs as a uber eats delivery driver.
Faster and more consistent than Doordash
Nice to be able to kick back and have your food brought to you.
I had an account with uber eats I receive emails etc and now my account has been signed out of and all it says for me is to get started there is no sign in option. The app could do with a sign in option.
Everything worked smoothly with some nice features.
"La aplicación funciona bastante bien, pero el servicio en general no. El día domingo 16 de febrero hicimos un pedido y la comida no llegó, pero el repartidor sí cerró la orden indicando que lo ordenado había sido recibido. Luego repetimos, pero esta vez el repartidor se desconectó en pleno trayecto y la comida jamás fue retirada en el local. Nos devolvieron el dinero y terminamos ordenando por Rappi. Recibimos la comida en menos de media hora. Uber Eats no demostró ninguna preocupación."
Hey I tried that couldn't find nothing that helped me
Super easy and convenient.
"Poor. Terrible, useless customer service, do you even read my queries?! And why can't we see other people's written reviews? Fix up. Also, the free delivery promotion doesn't update properly lol. Just a method to pressure you into ordering from somewhere quickly. What a joke. Edit to reply to your response: I already contacted your 'customer service' and got nowhere. You got back to me, I'll give you that, but you offered no resolution or refund. Sooo..."
"Good user experience, does what's need to do"
"I know this app is good.. But it stopped working? Keeps saying can't process my request. I've tried updating me personal details, payment method, uninstalling, install again and rebooting my phone. It just won't work 😭 please help? Anyone?"
Waste my time
Uber eats are scam artists they say free delivery but then you get charged a service fee and some other fees I hope that the news investigation team will show that
App won't go past enter an address....
So first it was regular Uber not taking my ride request and telling me that 'something went wrong' and I got passed around the customer service department .. it's still not working. And now Uber Eats does the same thing. Do you not want my money? No help from them at all .. the last interaction I was basically told 'We don't know what's wrong .. sorry' Awesome *sarcasm*
Excellent 👌
"Do not use this service. I had to out the order in twice because the app refreshed and it doesn't save. Delivery estimates are complete fiction. STILL waiting for food ordered an hour and 40 minutes ago. Funnily enough, the app crashes when I try to cancel."
"There's a McDonald's near that offer uber eats delivery, but when I open the app it says ,""we're are not quite were you are yet"". So im really confused"
Helps when you quite tired from other tasks in the day.
"Una basura de servicio. Si cobran los pedidos cuando uno los cancela, mejor que aclaren que no se pueden cancelar. Por error hice un pedido de más de 100 y lo cancelé. Aún así me lo cobraron."
"I used this app almost daily to order, it was mostly good with the occasional order mess up, but the call support customer service is the absolute WORST! I was placed on extended holds numerous times, the supervisor & the associate both argued and badgered me, and were unwilling to work with or help me. RIDICULOUS! I would not recommend using this service, doordash or Grubhub will now be my go to."
EXCELLENT
It's an app. Does the job. It is nothing particularly memorable
UBER Eats is trash I am a truck driver so I used this app a lot. However I made a order that had the wrong address and state. Tried to cancel but wouldn't give me the option to cancel or even contact driver. I had to call the 1800 number but was told after the put me on hold many times that the order would be canceled but they were not going to refund me my order. So the deliver driver got a free $22 meal. So Uber can kiss my *** I will never use any Uber services again. Deleted all Uber apps
"recent update issue, can't see places and if searched errors out during payment processing"
Most delivery fees and charges are high compared to other food delivery apps.
Deliveries take forever and a day. They sent my order 40 blocks on a bike. Redicilous.
Please Uber eats wapas Aajao
good
Keeps crashing. It crashes in many different times. When I open the 2 for 1 discount for example. When I'm browsing some restaurant.
"This is a very bad app, they pull out offers all days but Every time I used an offer I had to fight them back every time for the money (something always fails) ... I'm sick entire that these big companies can do whatever they want and get away with it, and growing.. Be careful on their offers, I just uninstalled this app. I've contacted again with support team and as I cannot prove that what I did was ok and that the app didn't work ok, they've just ignored me. Don't recommend this app!!18/02"
"I think 2 out of every 10 orders placed are correct. Don't get me wrong, I still use the app. But it's the same with all these delivery places. Half the time the items are wrong, and the other half the items are missing. The app functions well though."
"Enjoying Uber eats. Simple to use , get my food on time and friendly Uber eats drivers."
I wish coming to Pakistan I love uber
Tried ordering my girlfriend lunch several times and it gets cancelled the last minute of the time window it's supposed to be delivered. Useless.
Love it!
"Much easy to use, great vegan options now!"
Uber eats is the best
Awesome
Wooooaaa
All Good
They have constantly given poor service and ecen taken extra money out of my account and telling me they cant help resolve it and appreciate my understanding..i am fuming as nobody seems to want to help resolve my issue and just saying they want to continue to improve service. I will not be using them again and wi be telling everyone i know how they treat their customers.
Cool
"Simplesmente não realiza o pagamento. Mesmo com todos dados de conta, pedido e cartão adicionado. Nunca consegui realizar um pedido e sempre vou para o ifood!"
Why can't I use this app without the Uber app? Which I don't need!
"When items are missing, don't expect to get any help straight away. We once had almost half the order missing. I noticed straight away and the driver would tell you to contact Uber Eats. Contact Uber who would not get back to you until the next day. I understand that mistakes happen but it is frustrating when no one takes responsibility of resolving the issue and you're left with a hungry family. There needs to be a better system in place. Happened again today when my brother ordered."
Lekker man
"After getting installed, There is no option to login with existing email id, as it is showing already registered but i am unable to open with existing email id..there is no option showing after getting install uber eats.."
It didn't work! Asked my address 2x's? Wouldn't let me select date or time!! Totally Sucked!! You know the 1st time I ever ordered Uber it took my money!! Driver didn't show. They were sorry!! But no offer to refund MONEY!! Just Credit!! Well that was over 1 yr. & never got to use them!! I can ONLY imagine How Much $$$$ they have Made on Mistakes!! THAT'S WHY THEY GET THE BIG BUCKS!! Not the Drivers!!
Not available in Pakistan
Great app i love it.
Is awsome
Good app.. need to add more restaurants.
I can not use my uber credits it keeps saying update the billing option?
I've ordered the same place many times and it says Its too far now...?
Amazing
No order notes available! Especially to tell mcdonalds to stop sending raw chips!!
Excellent service
I recieved an order that was damaged because the driver put our soft drinks in the same hot bag as our food and the sodas spilled. Our Food was soaked and the bag broke cause the food to spill on the floor. When I reported the incident through the support system in the app I was offered 5$ in ubercash as reimbursement. The order cost 24$. 4 days of no response only to be refused. Save youself some agrivation and go with one of the multiple other services out there.
Efficient and cost effective. Love the promos!
great
There good and professional
"Those guys are crazy, two meals the prize are $26. And then I going to pay $36, almost $40 no way. I'm so sorry but you're crazy"
Chaching
"Great app, convenience ga o nyako becha banyana, ba tlala ka sa lepara one way tsotsi!!!"
"Muy mala, perdí 7 mil pesos porque la APLICACION no explico bien el procedimiento de poner un cupón."
Terrible. Everything is over priced
I love using this app it's very convenient I always get the best customer service on here I have switched from door dash and postmates to ubereats the prices are way better and the customer service is amazing
Terrible experience wouldn't recommend just go to just eat at least that can do something for you
"App worked perfectly until recently. It now keeps indicating ""Unable to load cart"" due to the distance from the restaurant. This happens randomly and for restaurants that I have ordered from on many occasions. All of the restaurants are within a 5 min drive"
Great app for hungry tummies
Pages get blank and stuck after refreshing and updating
"I ordered and requested a cancellation immediately I was told to pay full price even though it had updated that it was being prepared and the consultant was rude, no where in the T&C's does it state you're liable to pay full price for a meal you never recieved and cancelled in time..."
Great service
Worst service.
"Did not let me exit ""enter adress"" screen even after entering correct address"
"App is fine, easy to navigate and all, great deals, but the services, AWESOME, quick, friendly staffs, keep it up."
Super
Great app. Needs more options.
Perfect
Good
Good app but delivery expensive. plus driver always go to wrong house and have to ring
Superb
Works.
"Placed order and took over 1 hour, so had to cancel order"
App is not working. Worst user experience 😤😤😤 I have installed this app but I won't be able to register or login into the application.
Good
They don't understand when there is a problem because they don't read the whole email . You ask them to call and don't do it. Poor customer service.
So nice
I have had uber eats for a while and like it but it keeps saying my address is to far away to order food. I have used my address before with no problem so I'm a bit confused.
Not working
It's good
"Order cancelled twice by restaurant, no explanation, takes ages to confirm order"
Marvelous
Amazing
Not working
Cool
Excellent
Want you in Pakistan
So nice 😍
Clutch 💪🏾💪🏾
This is a terrible app with awful service and no communication from the driver except to tell you that they canceled the order. Get Postmates.
Good
McDonald's delivered to your house! What's not to love?
Amazing....food always on time. Very easy UI aswell.
Useless app and customer service. Don't use
tax and delivery charg improve 🚫
Loved it
There is major drawback of this app is cannot enter the true location
"Not functioning properly, terrible customer service"
It' says I have no password and it never gave me an option for creating an account
Order take more than 90 minutes and didn't receive
Doesn't deliver
"If I could rate 0 stars I would. Your app is extremely useless. Tried to sign in with my Uber details but I forgot my password. Clicked on Forgot My Password and then you ask for email address I signed up with. I will admit, thats my fault I forgot which email address it is but you idiots dont even give an alternative way to sign in. I cant even create a new account. I get calls to my work place all the time about the food not arriving either. Anyone reading this, dont bother downloading it."
Good customer service when I had an issue
Good
Did not work and took money I did not authorize. So stealing from client's
Ok
Very good service
Fast and reliable on delivery
"Food is always late and cold. Almost every order has been over 30 mins late and cold. I have also noticed that the drivers pick the food up and drive to the opposite side of town to deliver and then deliver you cold food. I know Deliveroo do this but the other drop is usually on the way or nearby my house.Customer service is also awful. I was told that I will not get a refund. I didn't ever ask for one. Either way, I have deleted the app."
Excellent
They suck i waited all night and my food never came this app sux
It's the worst kinda app for food. Don't install it. Plz
I was really good I wish I could have it all the time
Nice
Need Chinese delivery butler
Goooood
They are not worth the headache. This app should be removed I will never use it again and they don't resolve your issues nor do they care about your complaints.
Good
Useless
First time I used the app driver was late and messed up my order.
Very convenient. Keep up.
"My food NEVER arrived. The driver did NOT communicate AT ALL! My call to customer service was disconnected. They say I've been issued a refund. They would not fix the issue. They talked a lot but said nothing. I will never use UberEats again🤬 No, the issue has NOT been resolved. The letter I wrote was acknowledged as received. Period."
Worst support
So simple to use your mum could do it Mine does
Great and convenient
Great service fast delivery
"Uber eats is a good app but the conflict resolution is trash, food was not delivered driver never even turned up to my house but was still charge, logged ticket told my fault no refund, explained the driver didn't even come to house still same automated response, replied 5 times reiterating that a to door delivery service have to come to your door for it to be a door delivery service, eventually got a refund but a major pain to explain to uber eats what their actual service they provide is."
Good app
They delivered very fast. I'd recommend it to everyone ❤️
Good reliable and does what it says
Absolutely love getting drive by doughnuts at whatever time I effing want them!!
Best
Thank U
"I ordered some pizzas and Coke and I never received my Coke nor do I received my money back! I tried the support, but nothing happened, I didn't have an answer! So what happen if I order, pay and don't receive the order? I just lose my money and time waiting?"
Useful app
Very good service
Come fast India India plzz some time
Overall easy to use App
"Not using anything with uber again, card declined ... PayPal declined and no... Its not me."
Amazing app very helpful
It's not so good
Sweet
"Dreadful,I ordered from a store 5mins away from me at 8:45am didn't receive it till 9:45am"
Best app to prevent late night starvation. It even shows several deals such as free items with purchases and buy one and get one free.
Cant cancel the order at the movement!!! Poor customer care have to correct the system.
"The delivery fee, service fee, small order fee, and fees that have yet to be made up are all becoming prohibitive. Still a little more reliable than other apps, but the fees are starting to really make me reconsider how much more I can keep using the app"
please update location place like uber ride because eats riders easily can for find our places
Support lied to me to avoid sending an invoice
Cool app
"Terrible service. The app never tells me before I pay how far away a driver is. This has lead to me ordering food and not receiving it for nearly an hour. More than once. The drivers never come to my door. And to top it off they have possibly the most useless ""help"" option on the app. All it does is tell you how to check the status of your order and basically says ""just wait. We cant control the drivers."" And they make it impossible to find the actual customer service line."
Super reliable
"I've never had any problems until yesterday the driver who delivered my food reported that I didn't pay him even though I gave him the money in cash, how can I report that driver? because I refuse to pay the so called outstanding fee."
Very useful app
The app is so good
Kept asking me to review app.
Nice
Trash
"It's all good until something goes wrong, like food poisoning. No adequate compensation provided for risk to health by Uber eats. Will not use again. Minimal credit to my Uber eats account and I was told to politely go away: ""there is no further action or consideration which we are prepared to take about this incident."""
Nice
We miss u in India.. Zomato doesn't provide wide range restaurant from all over city.. they only show resturants on location basis.. I literally stopped ordering food online now...
"The card verify scanner doesn't want to scan my card,I have been trying 3 days now on android phone"
Just dont get my location
Keeps crashing And like not giving me my food
No one gives discount like uber does
Best
"The worst food delivery app ever , with no refunds in instances of food delivered late and cold or missing items just done with Uber , doordash got my business from here on much better on the rates aswell compared to uber which is literally a rip-off"
Had one order that took way longer than it should have. Guy never called and I got the wrong order by the time it arrived. Lucky I had to do something because the guy came back with the right order. Overall I like the app...
"Uber eats maps isn't as good as Google maps, sends the delivery drivers to the wrong places often before they get me to me requiring extensive communication occasionally for delivery."
Absurd shite
Good
"Uber eats SUCKS. They suspended my account for ""too many refunds"" when they were legitimate mistakes made by the restaurants. And now they won't respond to my requests for help. Not one person has bothered to get back to me! I hate Uber Eats."
If I could give 0 stars...I would. I have had a order canceled 30 min after ordering with no notifications at all. I have had a order continuously say it's being prepared and never get a notification until I had waited over an hour and the restaurant was closed and it STILL said it was being prepared. And I have been double charged before. NEVER using this app again.
I have an unhealthy addiction to this app
I was without carseats for 3 lil ones ... We would have had to go to Jack in the Box if it werent for Uber Eats. Thanks bunches!
Why don't you remove this app from playstore if it is already working with zomato
dope.
Amazingly fast
No driver never showed up to pick up the order. After more than an hour I called the restaurant and they said they're not responsible and there is no customer service number with the uber eats app to call. I can of course find it on the internet but i shouldn't have to.
Love it especially when at work
Not available in negombo
Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's the worst. I've gotten one of the best food items and on the other hand I get missing and incorrect foods and items. The customer support is good though.
Awesome. 3rd time using this app. Very quick and easy
Terrible experience so far as it's my first time using it and was expecting a delivery for 8:30 pm then at last minute after picking up the food the driver decided he had a other delivery to do before mine delayed by 25 mins. Making me late for work. Will not be using this app or service. Better to use skip the dishes. They don't add deliveries after picking up your food.
Tbh this app sucks.. I tried ordering some food and it wouldnt let me.. Once i got my food ghe driver that brought me my food stalked me. This app is terrible
Very good to use while in hospital
I don't like that the app stop making it able to track the drivers coming to you. Uber was the one who originally started tracking the drivers. so you know where they're at and when to be at the door at on time. I don't like this new update to their system. They need to put it back the way it used to be. where you can track the drivers and see where your food is. Or if you are going to get a ride where the drivers at.
Perfect for my lazy ass
Great
Always wrong address
App issues
Amazing!
Very good
Not always reliable
Not happy at all used this company 4 times ordering from well known fast food company and 2 in 4 orders have been wrong. Last time ordering I applied for a refund on one item which was wrong and it was refused. I'll never use again.
It's a shame they don't have a contact number to call customer service support for missing food! I'm done with Uber Eats!
Drivers can eat your food with no repercussion. All you get is an apology and empty stomach
Maps need updating. Every time I order I have to walk up the block to a different street to get my order. It's not my app that does not work it's your own drivers who can't find my house. I have lived there for 3 years and your maps are not updated. Drivers have asked me to say please use Google maps in the special instructions so that they can get to me.
Keeps canceiling my order!!
Good
"Ordered four times, two orders were missing items. Not waiting for strike three uninstalling and staying with Door Dash with it's much better service."
The point of pickup was mapped out wrong. The food was cold and the ice was melted.
The whole team of people working at uber couldnt deliver a bag of food if there life depended on it.
"Good until I claimed refunds on items I dont receive even though I ordered and paid for it. Got an email saying my account suspended and I have to prove I didn't misuse th services, contact customer service."
"Great app, works well. Id say the only thing is to make sure about your location because its impossible to change the delivery after ordering"
Sometimes it's great. Sometimes they never show up with your food and never tell you it's not ever coming.
"Somewhat ok ,in emergency"
Terrible service and they don't allow you to respond because there is no way to do it.
Absolutely terrible. Use literally any other delivery service
Could not place order because they will never let me add my phone number and have it verified. I have tried multiple times and followed 'help' instructions. I will not be ordering through the uber eats app again.
Love It
"Horrible app, horrible customer service. You can't talk/chat with anyone. Foodora and skip the dishes are hands down way better."
"The map pip for our address is always in the wrong spot in the app, making many deliveries difficult for drivers and we often have to head far outside to track down the drivers. We should be able to customize where the delivery pip lands... Grub hub manages to place their pip in the right spot."
Puts a hold on the funds in your account and then after the food comes the app charges the card again for the full amount. Basically they lock up the equivalent of your order cost for a few business days and also charge you for your order. Good to eat as long as you don't mind paying and also lending them the cost of your order for a few days. Very very flawed system. Will never use this again.
Delivery is on time and I like that I can see status
First time use and had a great experience.
"Fast service, great when you don't want to go out with the little ones!"
Really enjoy the convenience in selecting where and what to eat in the confort of my own home
Can't get what I want
Great
Driver was polite and perdwrionl but the food was col ld and vary stail
Never given the nearest restaurant near you always far away so that you guys can charge extra on delivery
"Very bad ,cold food delivered, items missing did 5 compliant and 4 days now no feed back from customer service cant even call a real person to talk to . Please use it to order but don't use delivery service .I am goi ng to delete this app now it is rubbish"
Work for what it is
"I only ever use restaurants on the free delivery rotation and so far the selection is great; no issue with services. McDonalds is never on there though, shame on them!"
Always the same issues with payments
I had made a mistake on the order that I placed so i cancelled the second i had placed the order but the app still took the money for the order I placed but cancelled this made no sense to me and made me very upset as my money was practically robbed
"They had free delivery and they still charged me $3.99 in two cases. When I asked them, they said send us the snapshot. How do I get snapshot for last week of the deal from their website."
Nice drivers and hot food
"Tried it. Said my food was delivered, never was. 50$ for a 25$ meal, still trying to get my money back. Never again"
Terrible. I've been waiting for it to be available in my region & it's been available LITERALLY JUST DOWN THE STREET but not at my home for god knows how long. I contacted customer service & they did nothing about it. One star.
A little tough to navigate but very effective. Menu system is the best of breed.
"Annoying that you cannot change payment details until you make an order. I have had multiple issues with a particular restaurant forgetting items, yet when I ask for a refund on these items on this app (which I am entitled to given I paid for them and didn't receive), I get a threatening email to deactivate my account if I ask for too many refunds. How about holding restaurants accountable for terrible service?! Then when you try to rectify, ubereats of course has no system to help!"
The uber eats service is awful. They take orders even when they have no ability to deliver at the time promised. I ordered pizzas from a place a few miles away. The restaurant cooked the food on time and it sat 55 minutes completed before the driver picked it up. The restaurant kept contacting uber to come and they did not. The order was an hour and a half late and the food was cold and Soggy. Uber eats still had not done anything to resolve despite 8 messages to them. Use any other service
First time. I love it. Thanks
"Poor Customer Service. Placed an order, verified order, even wrote a comment under special instructions. The order that was received was not what was placed."
"Need to make the address more clear!!! Accidentally had the order sent to another address, it seems like it would make it more noticeable as to what address it is being delivered to or update automatically based on where you are. Extremely frustrating!"
I love uber eats. Me and my family use it all the time.
"My first experience was 5 star, but since then it crashes or tells me deal no longer available. I'm going to try again. Might go up one star/might go down 🤷‍♀️ Looks like another star!"
Quick and easy 😊
"The app itself works great, uber eats on the other hand enjoy ripping off Australian consumers!"
"Your support teams are absoloutley useless 3 times I've now tried to reply to the email response from them when trying to reset my new mobile number as its linked to an unknown email, and every single time I reply to the email you sent me I get a response telling me I'm replying from a different email address, despite hitting reply beyond a joke."
Great choices of restaurants and easy to order
Doesnt work. Has my name and number but will not let me sign in
The app doesn't have many restaurants you can pick up from.
Very good service
If you order and cancel just know you will still be charged for your food....even though you canceled less than a minute after your purchase. 😒
Take off some of these fees.
Awesome
The best
When I got it it work fine till recently it just won't take my money.
Very good
Great
"This app feeds me and makes being at work bearable...until the food is gone, at least. Then I just order more."
Good
"Uber Eats has no phone customer service, they charged me $29 for food I never received, I called the restaurant and they never made the order. I emailed customer support and was told It was too late for a refund and I needed to provide a receipt sooner next time, except they never even sent me a receipt. Literally theft and will need to chargeback the purchase from my bank. Will NEVER use again."
"You know what you're here for. It's 2am, you're all kinds of messed up and you need someone to bring you food to stuff your drunk face. Uber eats does it best. You'll regret how much you spent, what you ate, and it's rarely worth the price; all before you pass out with a half finished slice of pizza. But you'll be back next Thursday."
It works.
"When i installed the app,its saying that I'm already registered with my mobile.They then asked me an OTP i recieved in my number then asked for my email which i gave and its telling that its incorrect...what should i do ?"
Perfect
Could loging into any uber app be any worse?
YOUR S#!T App Thinks I Live In A School And Won't Let Me Order Again After I Have Ordered From This Place Before Why Is This And Why Are Apps Now A Days So Lazy They can't Get Some Live Support utter Joke
"But for a few problems with deliveries, the service is good."
"Dear Uber eats, I have downloaded the app 3 year ago and I entered my home address. And it they said it will notify me on what I can order. Now I have waited for 3 to see if I can order something. Waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Awful service. The app had a glitch. The payment didn't go through so I ordered again. Same thing happened again. I then received two deliveries despite having neither order confirmed. Uber Eats refused to refund my second or and were unbelievably unhelpful and dismissive. Rip off. EDIT: I SENT SEVERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS AT THE TIME AND UE WEREN'T INTERESTED. AN UE EMPLOYEE ADMITTED THAT THE FAULT LAY WITH UE BUT THERE WAS STILL NO REFUND. I'M NOW ASKED TO FILL IN ANOTHER FORM?
"Can be very good, but also very bad with inconsistent service. Often times fast food shouldn't take more than an hour to get to you through negligence from the delivery partner."
Uber Eats works best ... I jus love it 🥰
I can't understand why you make it so hard for people to recover their access to their accounts. My old phone is dead and I now have a new phone number. It's been almost a year since I used Uber Eats because I didn't like how my order was canceled several times. I don't remember my password at this time and that's why I need help to access my account. Phone numbers are not a good way to verify accounts because you don't have available options for people that lose their information fo
"Very very worst service .. i ever met like this problem... Not a friendly app.. very tough to handle.. Dear friends sont see only the offer.. Very lower kind of service nd customer care peoples.. If possible call me.. not only one time , i suppose face the same issue many times.."

Zero support when order doesnt come
Full of bugs but basically usable if you're patient.
Application is working so well. Till you face a problem with your order and then it collapses and you can't access chat to report your problem and get your money. You just receive typo emails that they can't help you. Awful experience.
Tardan un chingo alv
Support team is terrible. Cream now has better customer support.
"Pedi duas vezes no aplicativo e as duas o pedido veio errado, na primeira consegui falar diretamente com o estabelecimento e foi resolvido na segunda o estabelecimento não tinha telefone, então não consegui falar, o Uber eats disse que estornou mas n recebi nada no meu cartão de crédito, o primeiro pedido faz uma semana, note que meu cartão tem atualização automática da fatura, não recomendo passo longe desse app, de agora em diante só vou pedir nós concorrentes"
💪👍
tldr: where's the login button??? I cannot see any way of logging in to an existing account. It just tries to make you register. I had the app on another phone and now cannot use my account as it says the email is already registered. There is no login button anywhere. Sad times. No more takeaway for me.
Better on phone than tablet
Good app other options If u dont see in postmates and Grubhub
Awesome
after checking out other apps I've come to the conclusion this is the best one ☺ thanks for bringing me food everyday ❤
Commande non livrée sans même avoir reçu un appel du livreur. Impossible de contacter par tel. La demande d aide via l appli se fait mais on a jamais de réponse. Au final j au perdu 35 euros envolés je ne sais ou
"Multiple times I've had issues with orders and about 90% of the time Uber support does the absolute least to help you solve the problem. Just today had an order cancled that i paid with a gift card,and now i have to wait 1-3 buisness day to get a refund, and it was cancled as the order was being picked up. My suggestions, more attentive with the customers and provide a something to the customer rather than a wait to get your money and order again."
"I cant use the app anymore since Uber thinks my phone number is attached to a different account I can't access. Would love to order rides and food but since no Uber support has ever helped me start a new fresh account with MY number and details, it's useless."
"Cheap delivery fee's, fast delivery drivers, and alot of close by restaurants are using Uber Eats to send deliveries. Food prices vary and tax+delivery fee isn't an outrageous amount. I'm very satisfied with this app. 😎👍🏻"
"Keeps saying ""welcome back"" even though I have never had a account!? My husband and both of my teenagers tried as well they have diff emails and phone numbers the app did the same to them!? So frustrating! There is no way to go around this on the app which is absolutely ridiculous. Uber eats really needs to adjust this. Grub hub is it!!"
The best.... can give all stars in univers
Coustmer service is really bad and food here is surcharged apart from the service fees and delivery fee. So your basically paying more overall. Also if there is something wrong with your order than your sad out of luck cause they make navigating and speaking to someone who can fix your order difficult
Very clear to navigate and easy to customize orders.
Excellent service
Excellent
First time we ordered .first class order
It is a great app and very accurate!
Quick and convenient
"Updating to 4 stars as the App itself has become quite good compared to the competitors. Also some Promos and free delivery options makes it impressive! The only feature I would request to add is a chat option between customers and restaurants, so if any update needs to be done before order confirmation, they can do it instantly! 1 star missing because I believe you can do better with promos and overall cost!"
Expensive booking fees and to top it off uber charges a addtional 15% service fee. I am not complaining about the restaurant pricing thank u.
"This application is smooth, straight to the point, and overall a good experience to use. What I recommend further is Uber Eats customer service. They are very professional and quick to help me solving issues with my order. 5 stars!"
"First time using it, ordered a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Over an hour later an I'm still waiting. No support, nobody to talk to. The service is garbage."
"Yet not,"
It's Good
As a disabled person it makes it easier than having to go to the restaurant.
Excellent service and app
"Pretty useless, food is always cold, normally late and you could easily walk to the restaurant, order and return home way before they ever arrive with your cold food you paid extra money for 👍"
The order came earlier than the prescribed time.
This app not worked
Terrible service. Charged me twice for my meal a week apart and then took them 2 weeks to refund the money saying it's not on their end.
Poor customer service
Location feature sucks
Easy to use and simple
Crashing a lot
I love this app. Very convenient!
Very good app overall
Brilliant app.
Good
Horrible app they keep charging me for food I've paid for .
Great service
Great srrvice
Mast
"Fast, good selection in my area. Just wished more restaurants uploaded actual pictures of their menu items. Other than that, great experience overall from the moment I open the app to the moment I say goodbye to the UberEats delivery man/woman."
Helpful
Won't let me turn of promo notifications
Love it
The best!
best
I am always having a problem with this app and then there response is always computerised
Good
"Hi. I can't open an Uber Eats account. Everytime I enter my numbers it says ""something went wrong. Please try again later."" Please help. I live in South Africa"
You guys should probably make a mode where you can pay with real money when they deliver the food overall good app
Bad
"Uber eats is a pretty great concept. The app is well designed and functionality is great. I've had issues with deliveries in the past, but support has usually been good although not always great (like a chatbot crossed with an outsourcer) but people I've spoken to have usually eventually solved my problem. Help isn't too easy to find - maybe add it to a few more places?"
Diamond level and I get no help when your driver's mess up my order. Stupid. Done using any Uber services.
Normally its pretty excellent
Faltu
Great app
Good food
اسوء تطبيق للتوصيل ممكن تستعملو !!!!! الطلبات غلط وما في دعم فني و الشوفيرية ابدا مش بروفشنل بالتعاملللللل!!!
I have been charged for an order that never arrived 3 days ago. There is no response from the help section in the APP after repeat requests for 3 days. The app does not offer any way to call customer service either.
Excellent accurate and user friendly - pls just add Burger King
Worst app
I would give 5 stars if they support paying with twisto
simply nice
Very nice and quick delivery
It's really convenient ♥️
Excellent 👍👌👌😀
Great
It works when it wants! Not good
Need contact with Uber team to handle issues on our order
Convert Zomato fools
Quick easy.
Good
"Aplicativo idiota, eles não tem nem um número de contato. Ficam mostrando restaurantes longes que não entregam na hora que vc seleciona o pedido. Vc gasta tempo selecionando o pedido e quando vc entra na sacola vem uma mensagem dizendo que o restaurante é longe e não faz entrega, então pra que mostrou o restaurante em primeiro lugar. Procurei no ajuda e não existe um número pra reclamar, boa sorte se vc tiver algum problema."
Really good
This is the best app ever I love how fast and fresh the food is always the drivers are professional and always handle the food with care. I just wish they can add John Doris Ruimsig side and a different bottle store as the one on here you pay double for all the drinks... it's too expensive. But super happy with uber eats
Nice app
Good
Not too bad love the app
Could not install properly
"Driver took me my phone , tipped himself and gave himself 5 stars. Complained to uber and they offered my $5 uber credit. Joke company, no employee screening"
It a good app. does what it's supposed to do. No issues
"Awful,"
Thanks for closing this app it was useless but ya uber was nice
It's does not have a great deal of discount. But it's good
My previous review appears to have been removed. Still no help with my previous issue
Apparently I'm already a customer! Which I am not. Can't find a way to change it. I've looked at the help page and no icon in the left hand side of the screen. Really frustrating
Excellent
Great
Sucks ass always take longer than expected and food is always cold
"I ordered a meal for my Mum, the driver asked for money despite me paying via the app. After numerous attempts, no refund from Uber Eats! I still have no resolution for this matter & you have been paid twice!"
Good
Always a good experience always on time
Great smooth and efficient
Its a modern technology
Crashes far too often for my liking
"would love more descriptions of dishes and food, just a little more than the concise explanation given in just a name. . but overall it's greatttt."
Excellent
"1st order made and never received, just kept saying a delivery partner collecting then going back to preparing the order. Then was cancelled. Useless app"
Good
Best online food order app ever.
I have only used it once so far but everything went smoothly..I was a bit confused at the R75 offer off your first order though..didn't happen ..I think I misunderstood how it works
Very convenient.
It did not open well
I tried this as I wanted McDonald's and can't deliver as my address is too far!? Seriously? Elizabeth is close to where I live. Ridiculous!!
Garbage UI. Makes C++ look like a solid end user visual. To fix: delete. Best -Everyone
I can't log in please tell me how to
Great app
Can uber please comeback??? Zomato doesn't have much restaurants
Orders take too long to be delivered
The app is saying to use zomata . Why i can't use it . Is it banned
"Scammers that never deliver all the items we buy. Refuse to refund and they don't give the required information to make a complaint to the respective authorities. 1st time I ordered some items were missing but I was refunded for those items. Fair enough. And then the second time I ordered, I was left with 1 item out of 3 and a message saying ""we are sorry but we can't refund. we hope you understand"". Understand what? That I payed for something that was never delivered? That's robbery!!"
Vouchers dont apply on my device. And specials are always sold out. Prices are very inflated How am i able to apply vouchers? No app support apart from this feedback.
👌👌👌👌👌
Superb
Perfect to delivery👍👍✌✌
Fraudulent. Debited a uber eats pass for an account i dont use and its non refundable. Like seriously who applies for a uber eats pass abd doesnt order a thing. I will forever hate i mean rate your people and food 0 or 1 or dislike
It sucks it takes damn long I ordered something 2 hrs ago and still loading It never showed
Open hi nhi horha h mera go to zomato bata tha h 😒😒😒
"Good to sit back and get food, however prices are different on app then at store. Don't mind paying for delivery but don't change the price"
Great
Nice app
"Don't deliver round my area and after 6 months of registration still don't deliver to my area. Useless then really but Thanks for making me have to accept your junk mail and junk texts that i have to pay ""unsubscribe"" from. Very crafty and no benefit what so ever for me."
Love it
It's forever. The food is always cold. And it's an $11 Cancel fee. I found that out after my hadn't after 2 hours. I'm going with a Doordash.💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Its not accepting my number smh
Has no help center consistently messes up delivery stole from me
No pay with cash option
"Will still let you order when no drivers are available then tells you it cant be delivered an hour later. Other than that it works well, just a pretty big issue when you order food and dont get any"
More positives than negatives
Great app easy to get around
It's very good job
I love
Nice application fast n reliable
Easy to use and great customer service when an issue occurs
Cant get past my first order. Occount locked.
I miss Uber Eats too much because Uber Eats true discount without any doubt and without any condition and excellent service but i don't know why Uber Eats becomes Zomato. Zomato service is too bad and false discounts and also make people fool. Zomato never trust customer review point about food.
Its working or not workong in zomato
Ok
Very high prices from market
quick service!!
Happy customer always
"Good service, satisfying 😊"
Nice
"I placed an order via UberEats with delivery time max for 30 mnts. Since the order was not delivered even after about 45 mnts I had to call and was informed that they missed my order and can be delivered in about another 40 mnts more with out even a proper apology for their mistake. Their irresponsible act made my kids left without dinner for hours which I don't believe any father will take lightly. Pathetic, irresponsible service from both #Domino's and #Ubereats."
"They have to improve a lot, the app design, the server and their promotions. I got an email with 90% discount on my order with a maximum of 20€, when I tried to order they said it was for maximum 15€ (which is still fine) but it was impossible to order due to server problems Also their app design is not clear and it is difficult to find what did you order and where did you sent the order."
Phle uber eats chlta tha ab ni chalta h open karo to zomato show kara ta hai ye q
Super service
Always a pleasant experience
It was nice using uber eats it was my favorite i dont know why it got sold it had huge potential it was fast.......
"I reek one-star because it does not give the customer flexibility to contact customer support or contact delivery personnel. What do you do if delivery guy decides to not move? Literally! I am watching him on the map and he did not move at all until the very last minute. Now mind you, a little after midnight at 1:35 a.m. and the McDonalds I order from was less than a mile away. Also absolutely no traffic. You guys need to add extra features for delivery personnel and drivers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Wait hours and not available
Good app. Wish it had all the options for sides for certain restaurants.
Way better than Mr D especially delivery time. Uber eats is on point
The app $10 off dosent work it's a scam
"So easy to use, great search options and categories to select from"
good
Scam!!!! Must be shutdown. Lies!!!!!
"Service is good, HOWEVER they recently changed their policies in California so if you don't spend $15 you are charged a $3 small order fee, which is outrageous. $15 worth of food is a lot for one person. On top of that, the app does not round up. There have been so many times I've hit $14.99 because the majority of restaurants end their costs in .99, and the app won't count it as meeting the $15 minimum. EDIT: The dev responded without taking into account their California policy. Not helpful."
Amazing
amazing app
"Cannot use it. I put my phone number, this is what is says... ""your account does not have a password""."
Fast and pleasant delivery man
Always the driver goes else where
Great
"The help email is useless and I cant get any help at all. Besides, the app isnt that great untill yesterday update, IT GET EVEN WORSE!!! I camt use either the uber map nor google map. I need to type every single address for both trips. Is that make sense?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I cant get it, where is the better update???? ERROR 404 CANNOT FOUND."
"First time I used it, got charged and no food. App wont work. Scew this junk"
App is broken
I want my Uber eats back zomato sucks..
Best foodie app
Love uber eats
It's slow. Sometimes hang or close automatically.
First-time ordered pretty good-size mealat McDonald's two shakes were not available so my order got cancelled never in my life will I use Uber eats and believe me and believe me we eat so I guess we'll go to doordash or
They dont give any caontact no..very worst service..if we are in problem nothing to do.
"My experience was eventful, tasteful and monetarily detrimental. Love UE over the other delivery services."
installing the app is difficult always some errors when installing
Great
"Cant make an account, thinks i made an account already with my number but i never did so i cant create one or try to change the password since my email was never registered to any account... surprised this wasnt considered from a dev point of view, when people get new numbers"
Horrible customer service!! Impossible to resolve any issues you have with your order using the platform. Horrible experience.
"Lamentable experiencia. Recibí un pedido de comida donde parte del mismo estaba quemado. Aún por encima la comida llegó tarde y totalmente fría ya que según el repartidor, la aplicación le pone dos pedidos a la vez y el otro pedido era en una dirección opuesta a la mía, por tanto, recogió mi pedido, entrego el otro y luego trajo el mío. Lógicamente, la comida estaba totalmente fría. Reclamé esta situación en al servicio de atención al cliente y simplemente me dijeron que no podían hacer nada."
"I ordered food and I never received it, it said someone picked it up but they never came, I tried getting a refund and it won't let me and now it won't let me use the app now 😣"
The worst experience I've had with food delivery service. We waiting a complete hour for our food. 7:09-8:09 just to have our order canceled when it notified that the driver was on the way. Then once I called Ubereats they hung up on me and did nothing to rectify the problem. I will delete this app and use Postmates or GrubHub for better service.
My dear friend when I'm hungry Uberbuddy
I've gone to bed hungry too many times with this garbage. Poor experiences again and again while paying higher and higher fees with increasingly incompetent support staff.
Annoying and infective
Amazing drive
Works as advertised
Good nuff
I love the fact that you can get the uber cash put on with the uber gift cards u can buy at any pharmacy store around then you can purchase food and have it delivered also being able to get a ride anywhere with the same uber cash!!!!💯💯💯💯👍👍👍🙏🙏🦄🦄💪💪💪🤔😘
they should look for the way that after the order takes so long to ask to be able to cancel or have contact with the restaurant to see how to solve it
A little pricey but great in a pinch if you're hungry and lazy
Rubbish app
Not enough selections
Hard to navigate for what adress the order is beeing sent to
"I cannot update my payment options as the app does not have the edit options, there i cannot order"
Need my money back now
2 orders cancelled tonight with no notification. Wasted my time.
Fast and on time !
I think they should pay more when you deliver to apartments. And I think they should let you know when you are delivering to an apartment. It's ashame I have to fear for my life walking around in some apartments that are super hood.
Super fast and consistency
I could not restore my account because I don't have access to my old email.
Just deleted this POS app.. If you want your order wrong then download it but other than that just go get your food and save your time and money...
"Fraudulent charges were made to my credit card through this app, which tells me it's not secure. I have deleted the app and asked that any account associated with my email address be deleted."
"It requires password, before making an ID here... Is it any joke by Uber eats... Not accepting my mobile no."
"I open the app, type in my address and search. It says down the bottom ""error fetching location search"""
Why does this app allow people to take my order while they're walking? I'm 40 mins far from the place and I get a guy walking my food to me
The support team is just terrible and the refunds take so long to go through when they cancel your order.
Simply great. Fast and easy.
This is the second time where my food has been wrong and I'm really not happy I'm tired of getting a refund I just want my order right at this point I'm just going to use door dash
Delivery and other fees along with taxes almost always add $10 to your order. Not worth it.
My first time ordering from Uber eats and they abruptly canceled my order. I thought this was going to be convenient. No explanation! Will never use them again.
"I know that the restaurants need to ask to be added, just hope they get in Uber delivery!"
Im done use uber eats
I like food
"You are too expensive, service fee, tip, and a delivery fee, even with the promotion it was expensive. Won't use you again and I won't recommend my friends actually I'm going to Facebook and tell my friends and the public how expensive you really are. What's the difference in a service and delivery fee? Heck ! I use DoorDash w/o the extra fees its cheaper and just as fast, I like comparing. Use Uber to bring me home from work, never again for food $17/ 3 items w/ promo 🤬gave 1* for the food"
Awesome
It's been good so far
I feel like a bunch of puppies.
"When the service I'm buying is delivery, a ""delivery fee"" and ""service fee"" are the same thing. Hiding one until checkout is just false advertising."
Siempre hay muchas opciones no disponibles por lo que generalmente comes de los mismos lugares.
"EDIT: It is not solved. I didn't received for my discount 😔 PAST: Their inability to solve issues is unbelievable. I had problems with extra charges about 3x times. Plus, they give us credits and does not apply to our orders. I had to contact the support, with no luck, the support basically told me that I got the credit applied, but my Bank statement and my Order receipt on the Uber app wasn't with any discount. You just lost a user that expend more than 500$ per month. Congrats"
Useless app entirely Trash Factually cannot be used without a credit card about to start using lyft because of the false advertisement this app gives off funny how uber eats made me hate uber more than its horrible drivers
Doesn't work properly and wont take my uber cash towards my purchase
Awesome
"Used this app so many times with no issue. The one time I have an issue, no help. Called customer service and spoke with manager she told me to speak with Uber corporate. I spead hundreds a week and this is what I get. Use lyft"
Legal!!!
Good and fast
"Terrible drivers ,horrible service with the app in general, the ""help"" section is just about as useless as it gets ,and my driver just went around in circles for a half hour then parked somewhere and he's still a half hour away ,it'll be almost an hour and a half before I get my food ,probably cold,because of this guy,never using it again,do yourself a favor and use door dash."
App not working
So far so good
Awful. Food was cold. No salsa for my cips i want a refund. Come pick it up
El servicio es inmediato y de buena manera. Cualquier aclaración o pedido es respondido cordialmente.
Very bad because I was couldn't to cancel some orders
I'm still waiting for my food over 50 minutes My mom is elderly and I was ordering her dinner and I can't get a phone number from deliver or restaurant to answer. 😡
Good app
"Conditions de travail des livreurs non respectées, mise en danger physique et mentale des livreurs."
Glitchy and unreliable app. SO frustrating!
Great and convenient
"EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE DELIVERY RATES Reply to the developers: I do understand that the fees change depending on my location, however that isn't the problem. The problem is all of the extra fees like service fees and ""Small order fees?!"" Which all add up and make the delivery rate ridiculously RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!"
Love it
"Going to give 5 stars developers please respond back the app won't allow me to set a time, any suggestions or should I uninstall and reinstall?"
Worst app... You can't make payment with the CC. No use of complaint also
"Terrible. Let's me make an account, great! But won't let me find restaurants to order from nor can I make an order."
All good
Slow app...times out
"Overall, I'm usually happy with uber eats. But there have been a few times that items were missing from order. I realize it's the restaurants responsibility, but I'm surprised the driver doesn't ask if everything is there."
Awesome
Great
Awful food was very late and cold
"Good selection. Nice for when you dnt want to have to go get the food yourself. Sm times the get your order wrong or forget about it, there is a mixup. Customer service always resolves if there is a real issue."
Perfect for me and my kids
Best app to get maccies from
eats-pinkya84cui 15% off NEW USERS
Great App
"I'm given the option to log to my existing account by facebook. website's support did not provide any support and phone support's were not allowed to give support. Overall, very lackful app."
"Great service, the fees add up, though."
This is twice now I have ordered and have not got my meal
Easy to.use and best promotions
"Useless, waited 2 hours for an order so I cancelled it instead"
"It's just too expensive now for individuals. There used to just be a delivery fee but now there is a delivery fee, a service fee, a small order fee and so it costs about $10 for what are labeled as $2.99 deliveries on the app. On top there are markedly increased delivery fees at regular meal times even on weekends when there is no traffic. If not for all the hidden fees that keep growing and growing, the app would be pretty decent."
"Very cool, very useful for fantastic unplanned meals at home."
"Mejorar la cobertura en todo Bogotá, hay restaurantes cerca y aún así no llegan"
"Not working, I'm hungry.. One star"
My food was delivered cold and inedible
Conveant
"Do not I repeat do not expect anything but a round about from there support team apologizing for your bad experience and asking you to rate the order and delivery staff to ""completely resolve the issue"" and ask you to respond if it does not so they can send you the same response again and ask it again. Don't waste your time . Go to Postmates where they match the problem with a solution like a way to get a replacement or a refund for the horrible food. Sorry Uber eats ,it didn't resolve squat!"
Fast and efficient
"Easy to use, convenient fast"
"Mediocre support that has a habit of saying ""unfortunately we cannot refund/compensate you"" when an error has been made."
"Just downloaded the app on my Samsung A20, it doesn't allow me to choose food etc... My address is inserted but all I get is ""We coming soon..."" I mean, how do you come soon cos I didn't get to choose the food that I want? What are they going to deliver, can somebody explain this to me? I need answers."
"They charge businesses 30% so all prices are inflated, their service fee goes up with the cost of the order and they pay their delivery people poorly... boycotted until they stop being so damn greedy slime balls..."
Food is missing
cant make orders on the app
Life saver 😋
At times I find the app amazing then there are times drivers steal my food I call report it and have to wait 5 days for my money back or times wen I order food and my driver picks it up eats it and never come drives all down town and to other places waiting for me to cancel do they can still get the five dollars more times then none I get my food though I give them that but if I order ten times this happens atlease 3/10 times a month can get annoying alot of times my GPS doesn't. Work right to
Really easy to use . Best ordering add ever .
"I liked it at first, but it has now for the third damn time given me a terrible delivery driver. It's been almost 3 hours since my order should've been here, yet I still don't have it. Driver has driven past where my order was placed 5 times, and even went to Tacoma and just sat in the same spot for 15 minutes straight. And there are other reviews like mine that complain about similar issues that the developers refuse to fix. I'd give this app zero stars if I could"
Super buenos restaurantes ! Me encanta
I cant order no food and I got money on credits
"The delivery person stole my order. She never arrived and as I was tracking her I found put that as soon as she neared my apartement complex, she just said that the order was delivered. She never showed up and I need my money back. It's a very stupid app and people steal your food. It's not safe to use as they won't even reply to your messages and your money is also lost. It is a very bad app. Highly recommend to not use it."
Great
I like uber eat but sometimes there expensive good app though to order food
Excellent!
Excellent
"Why does it let you pick a restaurant, add dishes to the cart and then throw server error on checkout - your location is too far? Wasting time every time"
I just got a new phone number and it won't let me register because whoever had this phone before the number is connected to their email bummer and this was going to be my first time ordering off of uber eats darn
Fantastic service
"Aweful availability of restaurants. You can see plenty of options but they are constantly unavailable. Supposedly they do McDonald's delivery, still have to see it available once since a few weeks back. Just another joke of a service they overcharges you for often late delivery."
Love the app. Just wish we had the option to change drivers
The worst experience i ever had with this kind of app i waited more than 1 hour for 3 mc savers from a mc donalds that is literally 8 min away from my home the agent that gave me the support only sent some predefined messages that didn't help at all i ended up making my own dinner.
Good
Has been asking for delivery address for at least a week. Won't connect or accept an address.
"Easy to use, lots of options (depending on your location), and works well. The fees can be a little steep if you're just ordering for a single person, but if you're getting food for a group, or for more than one meal, it can be worth the convenience."
"The delivery is often late and unhelpful with any problems with your order, you are better off trying another food delivery app"
Great and easy to use
Great app
Fair
They didnt even have it where i was
Very convient
It came before time and still hot
Never works. Always get stuck at error cant find location.
Terrible
Ok
App donot work for me
Best app to order food don't need to drive free strees
Uber Eats will charge you whether you receive the order on not; even if you contact them in a timely manner to cancel the order due to an incorrect delivery address.
Great
Love that I can place an order to have delivered to my kids or parents while I'm away from the house. So very convenient.
Downloaded was told in local paper Dorset echo that they where expanding in our town. And still its limited to 1 or 2 miles in any direction from a restaurant or town centre. Not on. They keep saying check back. But its pointless as its been years and no change. 0/10. As they are picking and choosing who to serve.
By far the most ridiculous excuses of locations to far...
Makes life alot more convenient
Every order is like fast food bingo!!? Will the whole order arrive or will you only get part of the order?? Fast food delivery Russian roulette!! Shockingly woeful. Avoid!!!
Love it
"Je ne peux pas me connecter avec mon email, seulement avec un numero de téléphone mais je n'ai jamais utilisé mon numéro pour créer un compte, du coup quand j'entre un mdp et l'email associé au compte du numéro ça ne marche pas. Et bien sur, sur le site uber eat je ne peux pas associer un numéro a mon compte (créé avec email) pour régler le problème."
Great experiences so far so good..👍🏾
"Wish I could give it 5 stars, perhaps I will in the future they have made it easier for us to receive our food. But I will give 5 stars once uber eats enforces seals to protect our food from beind tampered with. Also would like more choices added."
Uber Eats is Great. The One thing I would change is that all orders & drinks are delivered sealed shut. Uber Eats is awesome.
Good
Promotional offers do not work on my account even when valid and with the prescribed time frame
Easy to use
"Lots of options and quick , easy to use"
Food!!!!!
Pricey
Excellent
I had a delivery delivered to the wrong address and contacted them and after 1hr nothing happened. Being really hungry this thing basically ruined my day. Had to order from somewhere else and my 5 year old had to wait 2 hrs in total to get some food. Ridiculous would never recommend this to anyone. With other apps you can get in contact witb tb restaurant and they at least give you updates on what's going on so you would know what to do next.
Makes my life easy!
Good
Love em!!!!
Easy
Always something wrong with the orders or orders do not even arrive. How do i delete my account?
No costumer help
"While you can Track your driver in real time for when he's going to drop off your order. Since 2 weeks ago (beginning of Feb) almost any times I order from a place that's over 1 mile away is ""too far away"" so now the app is just about unusable. Using other food delivery apps. After using other apps found the selection Uber eats has near me is alot smaller than other apps."
Good
App was awesome till i logged in today and it wouldnt even let me search an address. Rest in peace.
Youtube放那麼多廣告也不會讓大家不用Foodpanda改用Uber eat 可以不要再放廣告了嗎 一個影片五個欸？
Good and fast
Keeps on telling me my account is locked untill I confirm it on Uber app. Even when I have everything confirmed
When i recently install they said that go to zomato wt happend to uber eats not working
Arrived within the allocated time and the food was nice and hot. I guess it's a choice between paying £3.50 delivery or going yourself and I'm only 100m away from nearly twenty fast food places but football is on so it was delivered.
Excellent!
"Got charged for something I never ordered/approved and Uber Eats refused to provide a refund. Terrible and unresponsive customer service. App and account deleted. For a company so wealthy, it is unacceptable"
Bad service from Uber eats. Had a massive issue with my order with food being raw and cold and added in sauce that I was allergic to. I contacted them and it took them a whole hour to respond which by that time I had not eaten and the whole evening just became a disappointment. Do not use this app use deliveroo or just eat instead they are much better.
i 💝ubereats muje ess se badya food app. nahi ho sakta think ing U
Amzining experience
"Péssimo atendimento ao consumidor mesmo sendo cliente ouro! O app aparentemente deixou de suportar pagamentos com ticket restaurante e não avisa ao usuário de tal coisa. Mesmo selecionando ticket como forma de pagamento, o pedido depois é cobrado no cartão de crédito sem consentimento do usuário. Ao buscar suporte, as mensagens são sempre repetidas e te respondem com nome aleatório, mostrando que sequer leu com atenção o problema. Péssimo serviço!"
"I ordered dennys (literal 2 minutes away from my house, 10 minute walk) and the driver had picked up the order after an hour, and then got on the highway, went the complete opposite direction (to the airport actually, 15 minutes away) and then came to drop off my food. By the time it got here (1 hour and 45 minutes after placing the order) everything was cold, i still ate it. Now i woke up the next morning with what feels like food poisoning. I dont know whether to blame the driver or dennys"
Faulty
"Fiz uma compra de uma promoção onde comprava-se 1 e ganhava outro. Fiz a compra e do chegou 1 hambúrguer. A loja disse que não pode fazer nada e a Uber só me dá respostas automáticas, não resolvem nada. Paguei um absurdo e só ganhei 1 hambúrguer. Por isso a Uber Eats será sempre atrás de seus concorrentes. Ifood é 100000 vezes melhor, um abismo de diferença."
Every order I have theirs always something wrong with it. Dont even have the full menu for combos and whatever. Also yall charge more for the food then what it really cost !!! Total rip off.
Great
Bawasir bhejte h ben jodh

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT MY ORDER HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.NO MONEY REFUND AND FOR SOME REASON ITS MY LOSS.... FREAKING AMAZING
Good
👌 love the app
Your venders continue to make mistakes with orders..how hard is it to follow up on orders that are placed...if you want your drivers to receive a tip for a specific percentage that you choose..on top of the service fees and the taxes...then make my sure my order is correct..its not rocket science..if I'm too lazy to go to the restaurant for food...when I have to over pay to use your service...then u better make sure the order is correct!
"Never get what you order, and if you do get what you order it's either cold or the person delivering expects a tip. Better off just going to get it your self."
Easy to use app.
Perfect
Delivery and quality of food delivered often lacking
Ordered for 2 but received only one
Not required this app anymore post acquisition.
Does app needs Popeyes
Its opening and exiting same time
Only thing I don't like is I cannot ask for any changes to the items. I wanted to ask for salt and pepper and syrup because half the time the restaurants don't send it.
"I'm so very disappointed. I can't even get past the screen where you get started, keeps saying ""something went wrong, please try again"" Well, tried 9 times, I've had it. Bad app!!!!"
Great most of the time
Why you people forcing to go to zomato that is worst app useless looting people frauds if you cannot runn ur business in market shut down and get lost

"While the app itself is an amazing feat of technology and I love the accessibility, uber's customer service is next to useless."
"Worst costumer support I've ever seen. I had an order and I didn't receive anything that I asked for. Tried to contact for help and still nothing and this happened 2 days ago. Just pray that everything goes right with your order, because if it doesn't, you're on your own."
I am able to follow my orders up to and including delivery. The live location on the app takes away all the guess work.
nice and helpful app
Nice
Osam
This app is awesome ! Its really fast
Order delayed more than 3 hours No one from Uber cumtomer services call me for that !! Really bad service
Very Convenient
Great when hungry.
Can't sign in
Not able to login
Constantly having bad experiences with this app. Terrible support. Orders never arrive
Convenient and fast
Avarege
Both times i order food was missing. Last time all was missing but fries
Orders are cancelled without informing no communication .
Muy rapido el servicio
Refused to refund me when the driver sat around in a parking lot for an hour and didn't deliver my food until 2 hours later after I had gone to sleep. I pay you for food delivery. If you don't deliver the food it is your fault and there is no point.
Super
Punctuate on delivery and courtesy
WE MISSED UBER EATS IN CHENNAI 😢😢😢
Good service
Great
Better for very urgent situations
Having trouble trying to log in to my account
"Constant problems, today a new one. 7min walk store is out of range for delivery server error ""order location is to far from store"". App interface is also misleading and there is no button to report/feedback issues with the app."
Good
"Uber gave no help when order didn't arrive. Other than 'submitting' a problem, there is no way of contacting uber to ask where your order is & why does your account say delivered when no one has turned up at all (we waited outside) & nothing has been delivered to anyone in the street. Uber to advises to tell them straight away if you recieve emailed receipt & your order doesn't arrive but 4 hours later no delivery & no communication at all from Uber. Will go to consumer affairs. Refund requird"
Unprofessional delivery service
Nice
Login problem
"Use JUST EAat rather than Uber ears. When restaurant order that you receive is wrong items missing, food have incredients that you said not to add to the food, it is me who takes the hit. Uber reply to missing items and wrong items is that they cannot help with this at all. If you use JUST EAT and order is wrong they do help you to get refund or replacement of the food. Often if something is not wanted to be in the food is that one is allergic to something. Bad service."
Great app
Good
Brilliant service. I like the ability to tip. Delivery costs much more than competitors like JustEat.
"It keeps saying ""invalid payment method please update billing settings"" even when I have clearly set the payment method to cash and it works perfectly fine the same way on my father's phone. I even tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but no use, it's still the same. Couldn't order a single thing from this"
I love ordering from my favourite places with no hassle!
This app has very poor service and garaunty for orders. Food providers can easily cancel your order without refund without any kind of responsibility.
Awesome
"Prices are way to big, a very small rage of restaurants with unrealistic pictures, and the most of them have really bad food. I once placed an order and the app told me that my order was not proceeded, hence I placed it again. I ended up getting two meals (which also happened to be the worst that I have ever received from UberEats) and I had to pay the shipping twice, even if they were delievered by the same person. Try Takeaway or Food Panda instead, better prices and great food."
I really loved this app but now I am upset that it has been acquired by zomato and I can't really use this app anymore....
"This is hands down the best app for food delivery. Their customer service is honestly as good as it gets. I love how the rewards cross over with uber. The delivery personal are professional, and i dont worry about my personal information being abused. I would reccomend this app over every other food delivery service."
One of your drivers crashed into our car and drove off!
"Love this app😔 but now it's not available taken by zomato ,I want the Uber eats back"
Y this app still not open..!!
"Not the worst but not the best delivery app, other apps millions times better than this as just eat for example, specially so many mistakes with McDonald's, or even more annoying when I leave notes like do not ring the bell or things like that, this just doesn't work, a shame really!!"
Can't get help with anything. Does Google pay work on the damn app or not.
If a restarant that's 1km away is too far for delivery then get out of the delivery business. Time wasters.
Very useful especially when getting food at night.
"Watch out, they'll hit you with those secret fees. Almost ordered 19$ worth of food (getting delivery fee knocked off thanks to a neighbor), but then they add a ""service fee"", tax, and tip. Came out to 32$. I can't imagine paying 38$ for 2 pizzas and a breadstick XD Edit: After having the Uber staff respond to me, all I can say is this: Can't wait til you guys bankrupt. Pay your drivers a living wage, or would that be too much for your millionaires? Can't wait to UberEat the rich!"
Cant log on with my email.
Fab service
Lol. Promotion must be limit. When i installed app. No anything. Lol
Its awesome
Very good app
Not to good the drivers dont know where there going my foods been late or canceled and had to reorder them they charged me twice for same order.
"I ordered some food, the delivery guy didn't call and Uber charged me saying he tried to contact me for 8 min. RIP OFF!!! I get no say in whether I got my food or not! HORRIBLE FEATURE!!!"
I am enjoying with it's....
Good
it's cool
Amazing
Awesome I'm a great Dane so I really can't just walk into a shop. My owner doesn't know I have my own phone. I tell the driver to leave it at the gate. Wood woof
Bad experience.. I added both cash and credit card payment method.. but does not allowed and say payment method invalid..I made two accounts and the resu lt is same.. dont wast time on this app
Good
Still I unable to register my mobile no with app😓
I asked for jalapino sauce ND I didn't get it and for no ice bt I got ice
Good
"so far so good. i once had an order i was not pleased with (a fault with the food, not the delivery), and the opportunity was very easy to report it through this app. so thanks for the otherwise smooth and easy to deal with delivery service/app."
Easy to navigate
I will never use this service again. I ordered food for my 30 minute lunch to be delivered between 3-3:30 and now because the ETA is 3:45 when I placed my order a hour an advanced. Then they won't let you cancel the order. Now I'm out of money and have to finish my shift hungry. This was a very unpleasant experience and I am sure I will not be recommending this service to anyone.
Worst app i have used
gr8 service
Great service and gets to my place fast
Cold food and slow delivery
Highly disappointed with your customer service. Cannot bloody call your support for my issue.
So far has been a great experience with ordering and receiving my food etc
Excellent service
"Awful, my driver picked up my food went in the opposite direction came back 40 mins later. When I complained uber said don't use the app any more."
Supperrrr
طلب من عمو حسني فته شاورمه وطلعت وحشه جدااا ومفهاش غير معلقه لحمه تقريبا وكلها طماطم وزر وحاجه بصراحه زي الزفت
Why The Partnership for Zomato .I'm Love This Before Zomate but now I'm not like this app
The delivery has been quik.
Uber Eats is the worst amongst the bunch. Their support team doesn't listen and they'll gladly take the money from your account but take 3-10 business days to put it back. I've had so many meals get cancelled after waiting 40 mins to an hour for it to come. Better off using postmates or doordash
It's not worth
I have used this app now for a while and I have not had any problems. Thank you so much for providing the app.
Very good
Doesn't serve well at October city
"sorry but I got questions about my orders, refund and extra charge. I just ordered McDonald's, it said it has been through the 'adjustment' twice (one time after I ask for refund), the problem is meanwhile my credit card got charged for $9.79 by Uber eats but I don't know why cuz I didn't order another one. so I'm really confused right now.. please reply me what's going on and what should I do. thank you."
Very bad did not finish my order but they said they are coming to do deliveries...of what pherhaps? And am very hungry🙄😪
Very good
Worst app
Why still continuing the app when they're shut delivering through this app?
Plz come back India plz
😍😍
Love it
Great app. Fast delivery. Great customer service. So far everything I ordered such as extra utensils were delivered. Happy customer.
"Tried to order from a restaurant twice, but didn't appear to go through, nothing in pending orders. Ordered from somewhere else and went through. Suddenly I get notifications that my first two orders were on their way. Tried to call, but nobody could help me and told me to go through app. Obviously don't want or need these now and I'm now out of pocket £30 which I didn't know had been spent. Ubereats refuse to give me a refund for their problem. Awful customer service. Never using again."
To many added on fees that other services don't do. Greedy greedy greedy
"Its good to have when you're lazy to go out and get food. However, one problem that seems to reoccur with me, is that when a driver is picking up my order he/she will get there camcel my order and i don't know why.... Other then that everything is fine."
Apretiable app
Very good to
Wow
Experience is good
Good
Generally good but they meals are mostly cold and drivers get address wrong
Thank you very much for the service
One of the best apps for food delivery 🎉👏💯💯🔥🔥🔥
"A good app. Only bad thing is when I got a notification saying my order couldn't be fulfilled, I couldn't get any more info. When I tapped the notification it opened the app but just took me to the restaurant's page where there was no mention of my order status. EDIT: changed my rating to 1 star and uninstalled the app because it isn't backed up by good service. Too many instances of drivers not bothering to read house numbers and going next door. Other delivery companies have no trouble at all."
Yuuhhh
Sold to zomato I don't like it
Great. I grew up in Tamworth NSW we didn't have this there. We only just got Uber. And I've moved to Brisbane and being able to order maccas at 3am. Amazing
"These people seem to think that they can change the service policies and stick it to their customers when they feel like it. Demand quality from them, otherwise they wont give it to you. Their cs support is lousy and they make a point out of making themselves inaccessible."
I ordered at McD my order never arrived vut they still charged me... I couldn't request an uber because of that order that never came to me. The was no contact of the delivery person whatsoever all i received was your order has arrived only to find no one.
Nice to not have to good anywhere or cook!
I love it
Good
I always enjoy the food i get
Pathetic service.
Great
i can't cancle and set new id.
"Come back Uber Eats, I miss you so much."
sad to learn that 'uber eats' is no more. in india.
"Horrible service. No support whatsoever, recently I got a problem with the payment, and there was NO number for me to call, all the number listed on third party sites (because the ACTUAL app DOESNT have a number for call to support) were outdated, and the only answer I had was to go the restaurant and solve the issue with them instead, but the issue was only and exclusively caused by the app. I really don't believe how a company like Uber allows such a terrible app to use their name."
"No cart management, cant remove from cart"
I like to click on uber and see uber eats or ride. Idk what happened to my app but had to install it again and it's just not the same
Terrible service. Unreliable drivers.
Can't order McDonald's
"This app helps u get food, but the support , sucks I'm never satisfied with my order because the places I order from never have all there items on the menu and theres no way for me to contact the store ot the support and the delivers dont always answer either"
Great
Always a pleasure!! 👍🏾
User friendly!
"Horrible customer service, honestly the worst i ever had ,and the drivers never answer either ,its a waste of time even trying to talk to them and they make you feel stupid with some of the most condescending responses.Doordash inst any better ,the only two that ive had a good experience with is postmates and grub hub. Check them out forst before wating your time here."
"As with anything, things go wrong, but I can't deny that the support team/customer service has yet to let me down. Very helpful and friendly. :) Good options."
De repente falla y no puedo buscar un platillo en particular o a veces el mapa no se actualiza.
Food arrived cold to expensive for delivery if I had order thru Favor could save $10.00. Won't use them again.
"I ordered something for it to have drivers changed 3 times and then it got cancled.. We contacted the drivers and also the restrant but nothing drivers said the restrant cancled it but the restrant said that they didnt do anything and I need to contact uber eats. So here I am, hungry with no food coming like I ordered. 3/5 (also I didnt get a notifaction that my order was cancled..)"
Poor service orderedbat 9pm and at 9:55 saying still looking for a delivery driver. If I could leave no stars I would
cool
"Was working just fine until now, just leaves me on a blank page."
Love this app
Good
Cool app. Good food. Fast delivery. What ask more?
Too many fees
"This is my 1st time using the app. So i had to try and figure out how to apply my giftcard. That part could have been a little easier. It sucks that there's a service fee and delivery fee and it changes depending on your total.... Not cool. Plus, if your order is less than $20( small order fee), you're charged a $4. That's crazy. Not sure if i'll be using this service again."
"Updated: Service and app functionality has really gone downhill. Local favorites dropping off the app, search function is highly inaccurate, and I keep getting suggestions only to get notified they're out of range AFTER adding food to my cart and attempting to check out. Unfortunate. I was using the eats pass and now I'm going to need to stop since other apps currently have a better service."
Food is always correct and on time
Not supported in Thailand
"There is no way to quickly resolve an issue if an item was left off the order. The restaurant cannot do anything, and there is no way to reach Uber immediately. We were told we would have to go get the item. If we wanted to do that we wouldn't have ordered delivery. When Uber finally responded 5+ hours later, we asked for a full refund from Uber (because the item that was left off was the only reason we ordered from Uber & this restaurant), but Uber refused. We'll never use Uber again."
Took my money
It is asking to redirect to zomato
Winderful
Will not allow me to verify credit card again. Now I remember why I deleted it
Best delivery service out here.
I tried to cancel my order and they couldn't cancel it because it was just one minute pass their cut off.. forget the fact the rep had me waiting for 5 minutes...Shame!! I've been using them for a while but after that disregard of customer service I'm canceling this app completely!!
I love it but when im using my cash app card to checkout my order it wouldn't let me im not the alone one having this problem
Extremely efficient
Best delivery so far.
Only 2 miles away and it wont delivery nothing to me it makes no sense
Fast customer service n convenient
Great
Very good
Good
Sucks
No places near me to order from so pointless
Good driver
Love how easy it is to order
"They've went up on their prices and are ridiculously overpriced. Wanted to buy a $4 meal and total ended up being $15, for a literal $4 meal. This is not including the tip. This is for ""small order fee"", ""service fee"", and ""delivery fee"". Are you kidding me?"
"Apps good when you can access it. Customer support aren't exactly supportive, called 3 times 3 days ago about my access issue and was told I'd be contacted by a ""specialist"" all 3 times - noones called, noones emailed, noone has made any contact."
"I had ordered a large meal on Valentines day , granted it was busy but I received less than half the meal ! I was obviously very frustrated so I complained to uber eats immediately .. I honestly didnt expect much but I recieved a message back in under 2 hours! They had already refunded all the items i was missing and even added cash for my next order. Honestly mistakes happen all the time , but its how those mistakes are rectified that shows how bright a business truly shines, from the top down"
good stuff
Amazing app
Trash! I used this service 3x each time it was worst than the last. This time my entire order was canceled. I scheduled the time 2hrs in advance. 20min before I was excpting my order it was canceled. On top of all that I added a 20% tip thinking that would be incentive not to give me sorry service...NOT
Amazing
Excellent
TERRIBLE SERVICE. They will steal your money. Their policies prioritize exploiting customers over making sure they earn their money as a company. Abysmal service. I prefer Doordash! I deserved a refund for food i never received. Do not download this app.
"Service fees are large and they have a3$ ""small order"" fee if u are alone in this world"
The app won't let me verify my phone or address. Absolutely garbage
Great app easy to use. I didnt know there was so many restaurant options for me
Best app worldwide
Have used it for years but the last few months have been having the worst experiences! The food is almost ALWAYS cold and they do nothing to deal with the situation. Not worth it!
Very poor customer service
"Pésimo servicio, últimas 4 órdenes que he hecho, no llegan, llegan mal, tardan más de dos horas y cancelan y lo peor es que su única solución es ""no te la cobramos pero vuelvelo a pedir"". Hoy fue la última, ya la borré, prefiero pedir directo a los restaurantes."
"Interface a not friendly and not intuitive, I can't control address of destination, I had to cancel my order, because order was delivered for wrong address despite I specified it twice"
Estimate arrival of delivery was 5.55 pm and they delivered order at 6.25 pm
"Reliable delivery times and a good selection, but not so great prices anymore. Between delivery fees, small order fees, and service fees (being that their service is delivery that's basically two delivery fees) they aren't really the great bargain they used to be. A shame, really."
Buggy and expensive
Awesome
Has alot of food options. Deliver has been pretty good . The only thing is I wish it had dunkin donuts on it .
Great food and on time👍
App wont accept my address. Keeps changing house number to a different number. Then says cant deliver to my address when I try to change number.
Good fast. Especially for a macdonalds on a hangover right to the door :D
"Fast, accurate"
Trina was awesome. Best delivery
"Got cold food, they kept my money.. they are thieving c*unts"
Zomato is worst Please come back uber eats 😟
Great app
Best delivery app
"Lixo de aplicativo, me manda promoçao e não aceitou nenhum cartão, sendo que uso os mesmos catões no aplicativo da uber, o qual tambem esta dando erro ao tentar usar o mesmo cartao na conta da minha esposa, me troxe uma pessima experiencia de uso e perca de tempo."
"I am going to be entirely honest, the ONLY reason I gave this 3 stars is because of the spam I am receiving. (Email). Overall, it's a very smooth app and I am very grateful that they provide you with so many discounts."
Best delivery service in Vancouver
underdeveloped. i know it's hard to make work but these guys can do better
Always issues with the app or payment method and never allow me to use my promos
Use it at least twice a week.
Too expensive delivery charge Never any specials/discounts
Will not update!
"super limited options for such a largely known app, somewhat disappointing"
Somehow am being charged again for orders I already paid for.
Limited options for sides and condiments. Extremely annoying and inconvenient.
great app
"Great app, drivers can be spotty"
"wonderful app. very good service of food delivery and respect customers. Uber, they were refunded me the money when restaurant forgot sending me some items."
Great...Thank you all and God bless!
Good
Why my account doesn't have a password 😠😠😠
Very good
It has become extremely expensive... no use for me anymore
Good amount of food options not just pizza
I payed ! It appeared delived but I have received nothing ! What is happening ! I don't know !
Great so far
Love it. Easy to use
I moved to a different area and service is more available. Very happy!
You should give us the phone numbers of those restaurants
Ok but one meal chicken sandwich arrived Without the chicken. This is because your selection for deciding What should be in it. Looked at the description of chicken patty And assumed it was an extra. And said no to byit This we know know is what McDonald's call The chicken in the sandwich. We would hardly order a chicken sandwich Without chicken. Please advise. Martin hart
"Then when I try it, so many drivers accept and reject my order.. so much advertising on youtube and other places then when I go for it, drivers just pick and choose my order and nobody gets affected but me.. i have already paid, the store is now closed and I dont see my money coming back.. i am still hungry.. sat out on the reception of my apartment building in the city.. risking my cellphone being stolen or being robbed or mugged.. i am never ordering from Uber Eats again"
If it is occupied by Zomato then just remove this app from playstore.
"The French website is really really bad. Do not recognize or accept certain credit cards like revolut for example. Message error everytime we try to pay with it. The service + delivery charges are really expensive ! (Way more expensive than Deliveroo). You cannot chat with customer service. Basically if you are in need of info, there is no one to help you ! Thanks for nothing Uber Eats !!"
"App, no issues Company its self is appalling! Shocking customer services. Practical call you a liar. I'd avoid, use just eat instead!!!"
Worst service ever used.my order completely wrong and half the value of what i have paid.the response i get is i have to write a letter to get a full refund.customer service completely unhelpful and i keep getting emails asking me to rate my experience but no answers to my issue.had to order again to be able to eat.so all in all 2hrs for my order. I could only post my review if i give at least 1 star but really didnt want to give it
"Me parec lamentable la atencion al cliente que hay,ni un numero de telefono,todo se realiza por mensajes para que te pieden ignorar. Otra cosa que me toca los cojones son los descuentos. En los descuentos que te envian, te aparecen los restaurantes que participan,restaurantes en los que ya he pedido anteriormente Cuando vas a aplicar los descuentos estos restaurantes no estan, ni aparecen en la app.Sin embargo intento pedir desde otra cuente la cual no ha recibido el descuento y si que aparecen"
It is so easy I like this app
"This is one awful business. We had problems and they would not help out. They took the money out but would not refund the money that is owed to us. No customer support whatsoever. Robbing liars. Not happy and have contacted customer services so many times with a promise they will sort it out, to then be sent out an automated response that echoes the last naff message they sent us. Poor customer services!"
"The worst food ordering i have ever used. I accidentally ordered from ubereats. Once the order was plced there was no option to cancel it. So i contacted the cuastomer support within 2mins. I even told him immediately that this is urgent please cancel quickly on my behalf, the cust. guy took the order reference and asked me wait while he cancels. He actually made me wait 5mins and then said the restaurant has already prepared the food and refusal would add negative balance. Never using ubereats."
Has a bug where it doesn't let me place an order cause it doesn't show reuqired extra options
Nooice
Pathetic. Useless. They eat ur money up. Waited for over an hour and the delivery guy ate my money and my food. Second time around that this is happening to me with these people. Rather use someone else😣
"First time I used it and order was a disaster. Neither company would take responsibility and Uber's support is farcical, robotic responses and no refund policy so uninstalled. Won't use again!"
It's okay
Not a smart use of Uber eats. They need to connect drivers before orders are placed
This app allowed me to make an order on a restaurant that wasn't open. I ordered the food at 5pm for delivery at 7-7.30pm. At 7.30pm the app tells me that the order was not received by the restaurant and it will be cancelled. I'll just use deliveroo next time.
"Constantly have issues where a driver is supposed to pick it up and either never does or takes 30 mins to an hour to pick it up. Then I can't even Contact support about it by phone or message interface. No contact support option on the app or website. I placed an order through grubhub after waiting an hour for my food to be picked up, they managed to make it, pick it up and deliver and I still haven't gotten my ubereats order picked up 2 hrs later."
Delivered someone else's order and did not refund me. Taking them to small claims court. Will see how you will ignore that. Edit. I have spoken to in app support and was told that if I continue you'll ban my account. So no thanks.
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Quick delivery..... Fantastic
"I logged in a put through an order with no hustle. I go out the app while my food is being prepared. When its time to check how far the process is the app stops working. I try to log in again and it goes ""something went wrong, please try again"" and switch to the online site and it says my account has been temporarily disabled, bare in mind i have and order coming through and i cant track it. I still cant log in even now, and i waited it never came."
"Awful. Refuses to accept my address, and so I am unable to order through the app. So 1 star for the app. Don't know what uber eats as a delivery company is like, as I cant order because I can't put my address in for uber eats to deliver to."
On time
Already have an account but no way to log in to an existing account on the app. It just keeps prompting you to register.
Great service
It was easy n awesome app but now no use as ubereats is acquired by Zomato. Miss u ubereats
Need simpler navigation and a simpler drop down menu.
Uber eats was accepting my credit card till yesterday as a payment method. But today it says that the card is not acceptable. What is wrong with Ubereats. I have no other payment option and no COD is applicable. Who can help me now to order my food? There is no instant help here
All restaurants constantly show as unavailable. Delivery prices ridiculous. Much better off using Just Eat or Food Hub
😡 Why did you sell your business to Zomato
"Great app, deals are useful."
"Until recently the app was working fine, now it keeps giving an error not even letting me put in my address. Hope a fix comes soon."
Good
Very good app to order food
"Ordered from this app twice in last 2 weeks, both time app says delivered, but I never get my order. Total waste of time, lack of customer support, still haven't been refunded which is ludicrous."
Excellent
"Love! It! It is absolutely the best app, i loved using it in Mexico, made travel life super easy!"
Awesome
"I appreciate the response 2 days after i wanted food. However, it just needs to work the first time. Make the app capable of registering a person with a previously used phone# without too many extra steps. You will keep those new customers from leaving before they even start."
"So I changed my phone number, and I'm unable to log back in. Useless."
Brilliant service
Good service
Horrible!!!! Worst Food Delivery App. Terrible customer service! I'd give it a zero if I could! Uber Eats is a horrible food delivery company and they do not care about their customers.
The arrival time is soooooo quick!!!!!
So far it's a cool program but the timer is kinda off and it can freeze up when timer runs out for the 0$ delivery fee thing
Lovely
MminZzzz
"Ordered from certain restaurants several times, but now its saying the location is too far, however I have someone ordering from the same address where they're able to place an order. Sort this."
"Good, easy to use app. However, the customer support response time is very slow when you have reported a problem with your order."
Good design
"While this is brilliant and in theory, I've just spent an hour trying to pay using all 3 options - each telling me that there is a problem. Ended up abandoning the app, getting in my car and getting the food myself."
Doesn't search for address
Good
Excellent service fast and prompt service with happy staff
"not bad at all... I had one experience where I placed my order, and the restaurant rejected it stating they were already done with delivery for the night, but according to uber there was still a half hr to go, my money was taken and I had to wait a week for a refund. I called the restaurant and complained that uber had them listed as still delivering, the manager said on his end it wasn't so not his fault... it was very bothersome to say the least!"
Y'all to good takin all my money but so worth
"I've used it couple times now and this time is ridiculous, ordered back of 4 and now saying delivery 6pm can't get hold of anyone it's a joke!"
Effortless & pleasant to use
Very easy to use and easy to resolve the few issues that happen
Issues with additional payments. All in all revolutionary 😁
Great service
It's been an eternity since it's supposedly expanding its area and it just doesn't do it. If normal uber service does why not uber eats.
"Ordering Process Very Easy, Payment Process Very Easy."
Good service
Got wrong ordered. Delivery guy never gave the right food. None of the food was mine. Never got my food. They expect me to reorder the food and pay again and tip the driver. Yeah no thanks. Uber eats never contacted. Food is left in the table no one wants to eat it. Because it's not what we ordered. Unable to find phone number to complain or the get our food corrected. Never ordering food that uses Uber for delivery service. Stick to places that have in house delivery service!
Fed up of it saying i can't order due to my location being far away eventhough ive ordered from there numerous of times!!!!
Pésimo servicio
"Zero possibility to get hold of human help when needed. Great idea, but there are better alternatives. Sorry guys, want to like you."
"Easy to use, informative, great selection of restaurants and makes ordering food soooo convenient."
Awful. Stated delivery too far away at 0.8 miles. Nonsense. Need to check facts and not lazy delivery riders
2 hours to deliver. Cook yourself a meal
"Terrible customer support. I let them know that I did not recieve an item, and they refunded me the incorrect account. I asked them to rectify this and they ignored me telling me they didn't want to deal with another money transfer."
Works great. Had a couple of issues with restautants before and Uber fixed it immediately. Love the convenience.
Better than seamless/grubhub and their unreliable delivery
No spot payment very bad
Nice people and quick delivery
Very nice food service
The navigation of the services in this app are horrendous. How does a billion dollar company get this so wrong.
"Sign up for them to deny you service, how insightful."
"Shambles. It's hard to navigate, it's unclear and I didn't get all of my order"
"App breaks - refunds don't happen I'll log in and it will just say ""doesnt deliver to this address"" I change the address and no matter what a choose it'll say it doesn't deliver. This happens first when I log in, I can't even look at the menus or places. I ordered something before online but I never got my refund."
Very good experience
Awesome!!
all I've been getting is payment error no matter what card I try. the app has been garbage ever since they introduced the service fee. use skip or door dash instead uber is garbage.
A veces el proceso de reclamación es un poco complicado
It barely had any of the good restrunt like portillos or chick fil a it is also very slow and the reward program is messed up
Super job
Easy to use
Always quick
Super
Awesome app
"Terrible customer service. The restsurant didnt provide my second dinner order soI had to drive there and get it myself. Uber eats said they could only provide a $5 credit for the inconvenience, which wasnt enough to even cover the charge for the delivery that i ended up having to pick up myself. And then the $5 credit is only provided AFTER you pay full price. I would never recommend uber eats to anyone. They could definitely stand to learn from doordash. Full refunds provided for bad orders"
It's so good website...... I really like it
It really good website...
"Dont keep up with estimated times, cancels your order while over charging. Would not suggest. It's a huge scam"
Worst
Love it!
Excellent service
Always on time
"Detestei o aplicativo, até a hora de fazer um pedido, é suave, ai vc Vai cadastrar seu cartão e buga. Parabéns aos criadores, perdi mais de 20 minutos tentando resolver o erro de vocês e ainda perdi meu cupom. Desinstalei e é isso."
Great service
Excellent service.
Ordered a kfc for lunch today 15/2/2020 and amr the delivery driver showed up half an hour late then cancelled my order
"I'm trying to open up an account but it just won't let me. I've cleared the cache but it still says that “Account has no password"". I'm fr Bangladesh. Please look into it."
Faltu aap..akane boltice je first 2 order 50% off.but ami 200 takar food order korci 200 taka e paid kora lagsa..amake 5% o discount dey nai...so this is a big cheat
মোটামুটি
What the hell....to this app first it ask for mobile no and then next for email and keep saying this email id is alredy registerd.....man if it is alredy registerd than give the option to sign in....worst app plateform
Why is my app not working it always says acquired by Zomato
Good
👌 👌 👌
Have issues literally every time i order. Just use door dash instead. I'm going to moving forward
Uber eats good app return back in India plz
Good to use
Terrible again. Delivery driver rang to say he was nearly 5 miles away as app had sent him there so after waiting an hour thus far it was going to be another 20minutes at least so order was cancelled
More often than not the app doesn't work and most restaurants are shown as closed
Samsung galaxy s10e patched to latest security update. Does not update rider information (static screen ) or reports GPS incorrectly. Makes it very difficult to report faults through the UI. Need to focus on app development and customer service.
Great
It is very well and some what on time but other wise very well.
App still sends drivers to the road behind my house as it uses my phone location and drivers don't look at the address.
"Constant server errors when ordering food and if someone takes your stuff or delivers it to the wrong place, you won't get your money back. Can be convenient, but the draw backs are pretty heavy as well. Customer service sucks unless you can get a hold of an manager or a different # than the one they give you for help. All in all 2 stars till they fix their problems."
So far so good
I have been trying to verify my account since last night but it says its declined by my financial institution. I also tried to create a Facebook account but it still doesn't want to verify my account
For real?!! I download the app and entered my phone number and it keep telling me my account doesn't have password you don't even have any other places so we can put password or else!!!!!!!!!!!
Most bad
Very good
"The App crashed and did not accept the order, I ordered again and it assumed both orders assumed changes my saved address without any action from myself"
Great
Awesome
Great app 👌
I order food that I never recieved and didn't get a refund. I tried reaching out to someone and nothing.
At start it was an excellent app but why the hell do you guys removed Uber and telling us to use Zomato.
Good
"What I hate is having to get confirmation calls. Plus, I also hate how if there's no food man then my order wouldn't be accepted. That's what I hate about ordering food online. But ubereats always makes sure in getting my food."
Fantastic app
Awesome love it
worst app ever
Lekker
"Not so good, price is high compare to foodpanda"
"If you schedule an order and the restaurant goes offline in the interval before the order goes through, there is no notification. You'll only realise that something is wrong when you check the app when you think your order is taking too long to arrive. I've tried to inform the developers about this problem before, but the feedback system is too complicated."
It's was a very nice app but it's now sold to zomato
Happy with the service. Thank you!
"App lies about drivers available, but will not let you cancel an order without a fee even when no drivers are available but you are supposed to wait for two or three hours for an order to cancel itself???? And then your food is delivered ice cold because the restaurant has already prepared it when you sent the order in. This is two orders in a row that are either canceled or delivered two hours late, deleting app because they are making their money on fees when you cancel. SCAM."
Hh
Best food app but there's not much competion in Portugal
Great way to get cold late food or cheated out of money. The customer service is also awful. They don't listen to what you say or offer you any compensation.
Excellent service just when your hungry.
THE WORST APP EVER . ODERED THE FOOD AND IT TOOK MORE THAN 1 & HALF HOUR . CALLED IT CANCELLED AS THEY SAY NO DRIVER TO PICK UP THE ODER. SO DISAPPOINTED AND ITS JUST THE NAME AND WASTING OUR TIME
Cool
Every order says too far from store now even though ive had it delivered 20 times before. Shite app
Amazing easy to use
Good
very good app
Love it
Very fast delivery brilliant 😃
Kitchen time is now invested in my desk time since I started using this app. Amazing
Can not get through to any one when ur order is missing items or if your order is not delivered. We order last time and food didn't arrived and no one knows what happened to order and its middle of night so we slept with food cuz after withing and chasing no power left in so we can order more and now order second time food delivered after 40 minutes and late night order and halfe of stuff missing what we received not nice and text on app its asking for receipt and discription and keep asking.
When I'm drunk I can get food. 5 star 👍
Fast
The driver sat on side of dixie queen for 20 minutes when he already picked the food up & when i got my bag my whole meal was tampered with & no drink
"Over an hour wait not worth it, time kept changing"
The app doesnt allow me to register but keeps on requesting for my number just to advise me my number does not have a password so how am I suppose to use it if I cant register my contact number
Great
"Uber are rubbish, rip off, poor service"
Brilliant App
The app is easy to use and delivery service is fast and efficient. They also have a great customer service.
I like this so much......
"I'm a relatively tolerant fellow and have given Uber Eats a few chances before creating this review. The delivery drivers are fine. The restaurants however, are not only completely unregulated but also have a tendency to be poor quality. Any disput on this regarding refunds or complaints is silently ignored. There is no choice but to accept their terrible service. Choose a different app."
Best delivery services
"Regardless of being acquired by Zomato, why on earth you are sending frequent updates for, I believe you already have put the page in app to redirect users to the Zomato on few releases back. Is that page is so memory intensive that you really need 30 MB size for the app? You have sent many updates after that. Moreover, you haven't updated your app information on play store yet. If you want to update something then at least spead credible updated content with relevant information."
Excellent
I order.. I was waiting for 30 min and they canceled the order!! I didn't get the pizza !! And they still charged me!! Wow ... what a service .. soo disappointed :(
"The App keeps saying get started with Uber Eats when I have already signed up with my email & it won't let me do anything else, I'm uninstalling & sticking with Just Eat as they are reliable UPDATE Yor reply doesn't help, I have a new number but the same email so wen it gets 2 the email part it won't do anything else because it recognises the email UPDATE I writ the message & tried 2 send & nothing happened UPDATE UNINSTALLED Uber Eats, McDonald's wil b on Just Eat soon I'll wait til then"
Never got my food got charged for it but no refund 10 days return
Great delivery guy. Great food.
Usefull
"Just great but there's always room for improvement, hence the 4 stars."
Worst app... Bad app Developing
Great service
I wish there were more restaurant options like with Mr d foods. I prefer Uber eats though .
Good
why you are a part of a stupid app zomatoo???!!?!?!?!??!?!?!
Really good service
best app..good app
This is the best idea since slice bread
Good
Nice
Great options
Used to be UberEats Driver was dropped
Great way to order food at anytime. Easy to use and great customer service.
They are willing To let you Eat Food that will make you sick
Your merging with Zomato not liked by people
Amazing app
Whenever i enter my mobile number it shows your account does not have a password.
In android app or IOS app i cant remove my cards. It has cash payment method. So why do i wanna keep my cards? When i try to delete it in IOS it says i cant remove only active payment method. Cant i change active payment method to cash? Why does it force me to keep my cards records? And in Android app the 3 dots are missing. Then how can i edit or delete payment option?
"I have Barclay Uber credit card and recently the cash rewards redemption was changed to only redeem as Uber cash.  I have over $300 rewards in my account that I'm trying to use for Uber eats but I do not see the rewards on my app. My Uber credit card is already saved as the payment method. When I click ""add payment method"" , it only gives me the option of adding credit/debit card and PayPal. I contacted Barclay and they told me it's the issue on Uber app end not theirs."
Great Shush
2 hour Late order that never arrived and couldn't cancel
"Los repartidores se tardan mucho, a veces no llegan. La comida llega fría ! Los restaurantes a veces no mandan completo el pedido!"
App is not working in india
Very good
Terrible.
"This was a great app until the last update! Eats Pass disappeared, it hangs up when trying to place orders now and no way to contact Uber to get help. Guess I will be going back to Doordash. Uber was great for me but I need a service that works!"
Good and bad
Best
Good
Fast delivery and good food
Need discount coupon now
ചിറ്റിങ്
It great you can track the delivery on a realtime map. I prefer using it instead of other food delivery service. Thanks!
happy
Useful but take too much time and delay deliveries lot
Very late delivery.
Owsone
Very good
Absolute trash. From customer service to ordering food this service is a pain. Also they tipped my food so sauce spilled out.
"I ordered a fast food delivery. In the time it's taken Uber to find a delivery person I could have stopped drinking, sobered up, and picked up my own food- at least then my food would've still been hot, unlike theirs. Is my order special- doubtful, it's a fast food delivery. Even if it is, the fact a delivery can be literally HOURS past their ""latest"" delivery time speaks *volumes* about their delivery algorithm and how bad it is. Download door dash, grubub, or literally anything other than this"
Best
Amazing delivery speed
Time wasting literally
It really works
Only 4 stars because uber accepts the order before there is a driver available so unfortunately sometimes that means you don't get your food after a VERY long time of waiting.
Horrible
"Ocupen pedidos ya!! Vale callampa uber eats, si tienes un problema te mandan a llamar al numero de soporte, en el numero de soporte te mandan a la app, de la app al número de soporte! Y así sucesivamente. Una estafa. Pedidos ya!! Pesima experiencia!!"
App is useless. Ordered at 9:50. Finally at 11:30 it just cancelled my order so it was too late to order anything else. Find another food delivery app and don't waste your time with this one.
Uber eats is completely inconsistent and they do not respect their customers. It seems that the higher volume of customers they're really recieved is too much to take on. My orders arrive an hour late which is ridiculous and there is no way to speak with a representative. Deleting this app forever.
Tried to order from my favorite restaurants and It keeps telling me the cart can't be created. I've had more issues with this app in the last 6 months that I have in two years. I'm done.
Just used the app and had my orders not show up. Which lead to me double ordering. When I cancelled the second order I still got charged 28$ even though I know the restaurant didn't make it. I know because the driver called confused. When everything was cleared up the person who gave her my order said no big deal because they hadn't started that second order yet.
awesome
Excellent
"First time user. After two people went to pick up my order, the restaurant cancelled it."
Excelente services
"App is fine, but service is terrible, on average. Drivers cancel without calling, can't figure out how or where to park (even when I verify available, free guest or passenger-loading parking), and no one can resolve any issues except to suggest reordering and waiting another hour-plus. Too many competitors; no, thanks."
It's convenient when you want to order food before you go to work
"Great.....never a problem with uber eats itself but sometimes the Resturant u order from messes up...but with that being said, u get some free food, that's a perk!!!"
Me ayuda a superar mis antojos
User friendly
The app is a great idea. The problem is they say a certain time and a certain delivery charge and neither is right.
"McDonald's app leaves Alot 2b desired.. frustrating. Included in order 2 Quarter Pounders... App doesn't allow condiment changes for just 1 burger---they have 2b exactly the same. There's a few other bugs, otherwise app works pretty well, I'll keep using it... And providing feedback. Thank you for listening. & I hope you have a happy Valentine's Day that exceeds your expectations... 💓 😁"
Happy with all my food deliveries so far
Not happy about spending 45$ to eat something without napkins sauce or forks. I would blame the restraunt but it clearly says on your website that they do not need to include it unless requeated. But there was no option. I couldnt even let the driver know. I might sound petty but this is half ass and not worth the money.
It's always taking more time than usual they saying it needs to arrive this time but always it's taking 30mins more than what time they giving me I am not gonna order one more time.
My delivery driver stole my food and cancelled my order but I was still charged for the order. When I called to get the problem fixed I got nowhere. I wont be using them again.
"Convsenient, reasonable service."
I've made 4 total orders and only ever received 2. I hate that restaurants even tell me to use this app. A crappy app that has notoriety because it's Uber.
Great app! Expensive. But thats just how it be.
This app is a joke most of the time they charge a service fee on top of a delivery fee and I put an order in and there was an issue with the app but they sure did take my money real quick but not my order and trying to get ahold of customers service is a joke and when you tall to them you cant even understand them and they are beyond rude that will be the last time i use this stupid app
Great!
"The uber driver decided to cancel because he had an appointment at 7pm on a Friday night, what a joke lets me know 1hr later. No Uber eats ever again!"
Over charged
Can't even register account. Rubbish.
"Wont accept my visa card, it said to contact my bank, and they had nothing to do with it."
Promotional discount offer ... we went through and picked many items for the cart only to find out that we were outside of the delivery range. Okay fine. But it didn't inform us that it was the promotion that was invalid it just informed us we couldn't order at all. Even though the store is only about 5 miles away. I had to cancel the order and try again that we could get the order we had already placed
Too many extra fees
Nice
Set time delivery less than ideal. my meal was over an hour late. At 6pm I scheduled my dinner for 7:15pm delivery. the uber app did not start to process my order until after 7:45pm. my meal was finally delivered at 820pm. this is unacceptable. David Settimi
My order was to arrive no later that 8:10pm and know i have to wait tell 8:45pm .
Fast and friendly driver
"Faster then most food delivery apps, not Jimmy John's but close."
"Terrible. There's an idea, let's make our customers wait over an hour for a meal, then cancel the order with zero explanation On Valentine's Day! And if that wasn't enough, let's make it impossible to contact us for help by making our app interface function incorrectly. Valentine's day ruined! This organization has gone down the toilet. I'm moving exclusively to door dash oh and now I'm going to lyft from now on too. Edit: restaurant has informed me driver stole my food and canceles the order."
Great for Truckers. Sometimes we just can't leave or there's a restaurant too far to walk to. Uber Eats is great. Thanks for the app
"Its fast and easy, love it!"
I cant even use this app???
Great!
Great app
"Never had issues with Uber Eats and if I have had minor issues, support is fantastic with resolving issues."
Nitido
"If you have other food delivery options, take my advise and use THEM! Uber Eats SUX!"
I love it
"Too many unavailable restaurants, repeating ""you're too far from the store"" but it's the usual location where delivery has been previously done."
Thanks guys love the taste and Presentation
Excellent
Delivery takes waaaay too long-- delay after delay.
I love that this app is easy to use and it's way better than door dash and post mates
"Unable to clear cart, unable to add Venmo or PayPal. Smh. So promising, yet falls short on everything important. Now way I could trust them with my debit card."
"I take one star because am in france and app only in french and another star because uber eat allow most resturants here to not put photos for the menu, so how can i order if i dont read the language and cant see pictures, and guess what also i cant copy paste to google transulator because app format diesnt allow text copy , so do you blame me for the one star ?"
"It says that my payment had an error, uninstalled it and installed it again and didn't work."
Poor due to not being able to rate vendors poorly when they delay my order and then cancel on me.
Great every time
Billing is problematic....
Customer service is pathetic My food was dropped in the floor by the driver and they refused a refund. This is just one of the times they have messed up
First order in 4-5 months was cancelled an hour later without any prompt or warning. Stopped using app because prices were consistently higher than competitors; guess it's an uninstall.
Zero stars!!! Waits until the time my was due (1.5 hrs later) to let me the restuarant did not accept my order. Will not use the app ever again.
I love this app!!
Fun
"I will not use Uber Eats again because my order was never delivered! I placed the order around 6 pm. The tracking showed it due to arrive by 6:35 pm the latest; the restaurant closes at 7 pm. When it got past 6:35, I called the restaurant. They said the driver never showed up. We tried calling the driver but he didn't answer. I ended up picking it up. I sent a note to Uber Eats feedback and haven't heard back from anyone. Not an apology, credit or anything! Very disappointed!!!"
"Envío caro, tardan horas en entregar, no te dan ningún reembolso cuando ELLOS tienen problemas con los repartidores, no te proporcionan automáticamente otro pedido cuando el repartidor cancela, de 4 a 2 estrellas por el servicio que ha ido perdiendo calidad en los últimos meses, pésima."
"For a relatively small town that can take about 10-20mins (depending on traffic) to get from one side to another , I cannot order from certain places cause apparently its too far away. Even in the same suburb your choices can change or have less to chose from."
"It's great, very convenient anywhere I am. Thank you uber eats"
"Horrible consistency, 50 50 chance you'll get your order. Drivers will cancel until your order is completely cancelled and your left waiting for over an hour for a 20 min delivery time that never shows up. Do not recommend for southern California in the slightest, go to a different service. Horrible consistency and by the time the driver delivers the food is cold due to tardiness."
"Had some difficulties ordering, said processing order for hours."
"Easy to use app, variety of restaurants to choose from."
Excellent
"Still familiarizing myself with the app, however I am pleased so far."
"Poor, app not working cannot order anything!"
"The app wouldnt let me tip. When itried to edit the tip amount, there was no edit option"
great
Excelente! Great app!
"Honestly a terrible service. The prices of items can be inflated astonishingly high, the only option to cancel an order is calling an overseas call centre, and credits are applied in such an idiotic fashion. Not at checkout, not once getting a receipt, but after all this Uber Eats changes the charge on your Payment method to reflect credits used. Tempted to never use the service again."
"Driver steals food, avoid them"
Easy and good deals
Worst takeaway app available with non existent customer service. Our order was ordered twice yet we didn't click to order twice. Why would I order the exact same £30 order of kebab 1 minute later?!?! App is intentionally designed to steal more of your money. No option of speaking to someone in app too. Just FAQ and if you call outside app it just directs you to the FAQ in app instead of being put through to someone.
Perfect for my occasional needs and being I cant just get up and go in any city I'm in. Fantastic.
Can't get into payment
"Error fetching location, error fetching location, error fetching location, error fetching location. It was working a week ago but now it doesn't work at all."
Great
Uber eat can't helping you for access log in and password never fixed in the system same exactly doordash. Sorry give you a BOO!
"Horrible service! Have tried to place orders twice within the passed 2 weeks, and both were cancelled with no info. 1st time, order was cancelled, so we reordered and it never showed up. Got a text the next morning the order was cancelled. Tried again tonight, and 20 mins before arrival time the order was cancelled. Absolutley ridiculous and will continue to use Door Dash or Grub Hub (never ever have issues with them)."
"One of the worst app i ever used, i suggest you guys not to use this applocation instead of this zomato and swiggy is damn good. One day while i ordered biryani from Ubereats of rupees 907, and the payment is done through online, in the middle there is fraud happened between delivery boys and app supporters and my order got cancelled without my persmission, there is no proper response from this customer care, the money didnt get return, there is no money got return and not even a biryani"
Love this..easy to use and great deals
Terrible
"It won't let me order. It complains that I need to update my phone number, even though it is verified."
Too expensive
I tried placing a order from arby's a hour I called too see if my order has left they said they have not had heard from uber eats this why I didn't wanna try this out ....
Good app
It will not let me put my phone number in
My first time had a problem my second time and am done.. uber eats is the worst
"So the app can't order my food and says that I need update my billing system (?). Everything seemed fine to me so I tried to reach out to the Twitter page of Uber support and provided them with sufficient screenshots and details of the issue but they didn't respond or anything. So , 3 things : 1) Multinational company with Crappy customer support. 2)The app's doesn't order my food even when I 'update' my billing system 3) I'm hungry and they ain't providing me any food :')"
Very pleasurable... Will use again
Great Service
Excellent service!
"Can someone please tell me how I reset my password, its says none of my emails are associated with my mobile number I went to the uber website and its completely different"
"Food was 30mins later than expected, ice cold and missing my drink. I called uber eats customer service to cancel my order and I was placed on hold for 15 mins until they found my order. At which point it was too late to cancel my order because it had finally been picked up. I will never use this app again."
Since I installed it I have never had any problems with it Great Service really.
"Delivery marked as delivered, nothing arrived. I contacted customer services via the app within an hour of failed delivery. No response. I contacted Uber Eats again within a week of the failed delivery and once again this week. I am owed a refund for items that never arrived but after nearly 3 weeks I still haven't heard anything from the company or gotten my money back. Where is my refund???"
Não consigo cadastrar
"Gotta Hand it over to them for their service and options. Havent faced a problem yet except for delivery charges that make your pockets hurt, even when the restaurant's near. But then again, I think the guys deserve it. I'm happy using the app over all."
Overall a great app
"Good app sometimes. Other times, restaurants literally 5 minutes away. Can not order from there."
Is ok
Awful experience! Don't recommend!!! My order was cancelled probably bacause of the short distance. I had to reorder and after more than an hour my dinner was delivered. That was my first and the last order from Uber Eats.
Can't complain
"The only two places i wanted food from uber eats doesnt provide service for. They have a spacific list. If your thinking of doing uber eats, consider this being your heads up. They only work with exact specific places, So you choose from what they have, not from what you want."
"Always have a backup on this app, of the 10 delieveries that i have done, 2 of which have not come, leaving you starving rather than saying that the order wont come, leaving the entire familly uncomfortable and hoping that the food that they ordered will come..."
App worked great for two orders. Then suddenly my credit cards all got blocked. No issue with my bank and of course ZERO way of contacting uber or uber eats for help
"Fed up with this. If the order is correct, and no traffic, and no other issue...yeah, that's fine. The minute delivery is delayed, items are incorrect or missing...well, good luck. No apologies, other than a canned response, and maybe refund of missing item. You pay a hefty delivery fee and an extra service charge...for what? If the service is poor, do they refund it? No. Refund all or part of delivery charge? No. Very poor. Profit focused business, with no sense of care for their customers."
The App directs delivery driver to incorrect address EVERY SINGLE TIME!
Worst food delivery company I have ever ordered from!
Loove ittttt
Great service
"It works pretty well. My main complaint is that it sometimes ignores your search to favor promoted items. Also, sometimes it will open up randomly when I start another app. Plus the ""rate this order"" is incredibly intrusive. Canceling an item can also be difficult. Other than that, it's a great way to try local foods you never heard of before."
If there's a mess up on their part they're still going to charge you make it hard to contact someone for a refund
Poor service
Some of us prefer to pay for things with actual money...your rivals can manage it!
Loved there service.. Way better then skip the dishes BUTTTTTT... How are they charging me 20 to 30 dollars a month??? That somehow can't be stopped...
"Had a problem with my order, got wrong items and only partially completed burgers from mcD and tried to explain to Support. They refunded me only £0.80 haha I tried again to contact them and they asked me what happened again - and I told them and not even 1 minute later they replied with an automated message saying they decided not to refund me... Like they hadn't even read my message before making that decision."
No support email or chat for an ongoing order it is simply a dead end
I tried to contact support to understand why I didn't receive a full refund for an order where none of my ordered items arrived. The support team didn't answer my question at all and kept stressing they can't offer me any more money as if I was begging.
Unknown charges from uber sa
Good luck trying to update your credit card details.
I like it. Easy to use. Clear about pricing
"Wasted alottt of time trying to order. Every time I log in it says ""we are not available at the moment""smh"
"Great, Quick and Efficient app I recommend others use it!!!"
Dupa ce am plasat comanda. A fost preluata si anulata dupa o ora si ceva....foarte frumos..
"I had a terrible service with this app, I placed my order and after 2 hours they cancelled my order twice. Would not recommend to ANYONE"
Horrible! Never using uber again. Support team is not very helpful. They still charge you even when it's their mistake and they cancel your order. Issue happened multiple times in the past too.
Awesome
Food never delivered. Difficult to reach customer service by phone.
Not impressed this is the last you hear from me
What's the app for drivers for Uber Eats?
"I used this app to order McDonald's, I will give them some credit, the drivers are quick but I was missing 3 items from my order and when I tried to report it on the app it wouldn't work, it kept saying something went wrong try again later. I tried multiple times and then rang McDonald's to ask advice and they tell me it's entirely through the app. I tried the app again but no luck, disappointed 😣"
Poor service and slow response rate to resolves issues. Competitors' service is ahead of this company.
Utterly disgusted ordered food from Ocean basket! After more than an hour and card payment accepted they cancelled the order!!
Excellent service
Wonderful!
Good just needs to pick up more surrounding stores. Also not impressed by the help options. There is no real contact details to get hold of anyone if there are problems. Also need to have a proper way of canceling orders as I've been waiting for over 2 hours for an order and the drivers keep changing
Was delivered the wrong food and had no way to contact the driver. The 24 hours customer service number just kept saying my phone number wasn't connected to my account and when I input the number it just kept saying it wasn't recognised so got no where. So now I'm sat with someone else food that I don't even like with no way to sort it out. Very bad app
Keep being bombarded with offers only to find no where to apply them. Now paying full price for a meal I only bought because of an offer I'm now not getting.
Wont use again. Things missing on too many occasions.
HORRIBLE! NOT USER FRIENDLY. Never used my gift certif because No One could help. Never again!
"When it works it works (although sometimes barely) but when it doesn't, oh boy you're in for a treat. Terrible support, tells you to reach to the restaurant yourself instead. What's the point to use this app if I cannot get any help from it? If I cannot trust your app to protect my consumer rights, you're doing something wrong. Yeah, no thanks."
"Pedido errado, péssima interface e ainda por cima mandam localização errada pros entregadores e o pedido não chega nunca, cancelam pq o entregador não achou o endereço, e ainda não tem refund"
Great way to get food in a timely fashion
Horrible can never get anything in a timely manner and today my order was canceled after waiting an hour for it. Uninstalling and never using again.
"I cancelled an order less than 30 seconds after placing it and it didn't get cancelled. I went though Help -> cancel order and it still didn't get cancelled. Called the driver and explained and he got ""support"" to call me. The lady told me that to cancel my order, I would have to pay full price as the order was prepared already. Really makes me wonder why my first 2 cancellation attempts didn't go through hmm... Uninstalled app immediately afterwards. Glovo and InDriver are way better anyway."
GARBAGE. DON'T TRY TO USE A GIFT CARD. ZERO HELP FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE
"Only one restaurant listed, made an order, the app took 2 hours to try to find a driver then cancelled. Tried again a few times at different times, the app has never found a driver. Feels deceptive, if you don't actually offer service in the area don't list a restaurant."
The delivery person Olivia was great but we were missing food and instead of delivering the missing food we are getting a refund. what about the person who didn't get her food? Is she supposed to starve because she cannot leave for lunch. Not a great experience.
"Mande a cancelar un menu en menos de 30 segundos y me estan cobrando por algo que cancele. No decia que el restaurante lo habia aceptado y aun así, me querian cobrar. Pesimo servicio."
Power full power
"UBER in general needs to get better delivery people, they have pissed me off today 2/14. This is the second time an incident has happened that I have seen a delivery person (SHADE BWO552) sitting in one spot for almost a hour on the gps map. They were probably eating my food that I paid for, I am displeased at this situation. Unless I get compensated, I am will never order from you all again."
Excelente. Ótimas promoções
Very good
"PLEASE DON'T USE THIS APP. TRUST ME!Sometimes they do a good job. But the minute there is an issue they will become useless. Drivers steal your food, deliver to wrong addresses and sometimes eat your food. Sometimes just blatant fraud. Someone from UBER eats charged $800 on my debit card and I never even got a phone call. UBER eats will not offer assistance. Just a refund and $5 credit, whether you spend $20 or $200. The more you use UBER eats the more these types of things occur. BEWARE!"
Pretty cool to meet new drivers every time
Love uber eats!!
entrega poderia ser mais barata
I pressed the wrong button and get charged for food im not gonna get. And i cant get a refund because the order was placed for literally no more then 10 maybe 20 seconds.
Easy to use and good delivery of the food I want. Can't complain.
Employ drivers that no how to read and no locations upset really
No problems
Food was cold
Awsome
They are hella slow. Always takes an hour for delivery. And you cannot contact anyone to see why it takes so long.
Love this app
The delivery fees are outrageous for places less than a mile away.
"I ordered veggie burgers today for work, a busy day at the office, restaurant sent meat burgers instead, restaurant was not apologized and help support still not responded. It's a bummer you cannot talk to a real person to get the issue fixed. Not recommending this app anymore, worst customer service ever."
Can't change mobile number absolute nightmare to order food off app it a waste of time!!
Amazing this app is one of the best ordering apps I have every used. The delivery is on time or early
"When I entered into the app, it asked me for a phone number so gave it and the app told me that I already have an account but that's fake and I can't enter. 😠😠😠😠"
Can't correct address just b4 delivery Sometimes we don't realise that it's headed to the wrong venue because we aren't prompted Like how normal Uber prompts u for your location
Call me cheap but its ridiculous that I have to pay an extra $8 just to have my food delivered
Zomato doesn't have the capability to maintain the service
Super easy to order even from the other side of the world.
Great service
This app/service is brilliant. In old Hollywood movies featuring the ultra affluent you would see them having their hired help bring them food from any restaurant they wished at a moment's notice. Uber Eats makes that a reality for the average person.
"Awful, not worth the hassle with so many other better companies around. Deliver wrong order and refuse to refund. Had to spend so long to handle myself without uber, as they refused. Contacted restaurant directly who confirmed error and had to refund me directly. From someone who used this a lot I have an error in 1 in 5 orders. Talabat and others dont have the same error rate, and they fix it when it happens."
"Food is consistently delivered after ""latest arrival time"" because they keep adding other deliveries on my order ""to save costs"". Fix the planning algorithm."
Always good Never a problem.
Had to wait around 1.5 hrs to know what items ordered are not available any more.
Amazing app and good food too
"Will not be using this service again. Order taking more than an hour to arrive, would have been delivered in 15 minutes from door dash."
I'm in love nice people good food clean gets your order right
Wow
Quick and convenient. Easy to use
Unfortunately it is not as good as getting the food yourself. It can arrive sometimes freezing cold and yet there is nothing much that can be done about it. The worst culprit is macdonalds drinks spilling. Putting 2 lids on Dosent do much to stop it and the paper bag Dosent do much to prevent it from dripping onto your carpet or even running the risk of falling out the bottom
Everything used to be good but I recently got a gift card and used it for my Uber eats account. Any time I try to use the credits I have it either charges my account or just tells me I can't use my card. If I have credits I should be able to use it. There isn't even an option to use the credits you have instead of your actual card. No longer want this service.
Easy to use
I tried canceling my order after it was confirmed I was perfectly fine that it already charged me I just wanted to cancel it but no matter how many times I tried it wouldn't let me cancel the order
NEVER AGAIN!!!! I Ordered From A Restaurant And they Messed Up My Order So I Requested A Refund. Ubereats Only Gave Me SOME Of My Money Back & Refuses To Give Me The Whole Refund I've Been Dealing With This Issues For 2 Dam Weeks Now! & It's So Hard To Get Into Contact With A Real Person Over The Phone
Takes top long
Very good service and friendly delivery
नाही जमत तर का सांगता इन्स्टॉल करायला आधी स्वतः ला बदला मला zomato नाही वापरायचं आहे फालतू सुविधा आहे त्यांची आता uber चा पण उपयोग नाही धन्यवाद
I like the prices Endeleeni na hio roho bwana
Got suspended because maccas forgot things in my order multiple times so I get suspended
Awsome
Very good. Love the promos every now and then...
Very worst application. Sold himself to zomato
Amazing
Good
I did not get my food I order it at 8:30 and now its 11 am I'm not ordering from uber eat no more
Worst
Good
Miss you uber..🚶🏻‍♂️🚶🏻‍♂️
Excellent service
Nice
"Dear Uber Eats, I want you back in India 😢 Why did you sell yourself out to Zomato? We were your loyal customers. Atleast help Zomato to improve their service and quality we enjoyed with Uber Eats.They don't allow discount on cash payment and we simply don't like this fact."
excelent
Gooooooooooooooooooooood
What a steaming pile of turd app... I haven't even used the app ever but I can't register because its saying your account doesn't have a password..... Easiest uninstall of my life
They allowed fraud on account..in in Ga not Ma. Then the rep said he seen multiple logins.
Reliable.
everytime when i try to open the app the message appears;We are not available right now. waste of my time
"The app lies about various pricing and quantities and the support is almost all automated, and generally unhelpful."
Ease of use...
Food was amazing and the driver was prompt and courteous. Exactly what food delivery should be.
Reliable
Good app
If you order drinks you never get them. Your drivers cant follow the simplest of directions.
I haven'ts uber offers
Service so bad..
Good promotions
Everything was wrong.
Very good food app and fast delivery thank you so much
If you have a problem with delivery there is no customer service to contact.
Not sppoted aap
"I am full of regrets as this is my first time on Uber eats; I got my orders delivered in the most bizarre state with sand & crushed stones in the pizzas and all i thought was maybe the driver fell off his bike on his way to deliver, I ordered for 12 chicken wings but got 8 wings instead, it's pathetic as I did not get a customer satisfaction in the goods money I paid for. Utterly disappointed."
I try it every year... And there is always an issue with my order when I get it. So I delete it until a year later hoping they've improved. 2 stars instead of 1 because I was offered a refund ONE of the times.
its awwsome but ild like to see kfc also
The service is extremely slow . The food was cold . Had to wait for 1:30 hours
I can eat what I like while at work.
Excellent
You keep insisting I rate you....your welcome Keep ignoring my request please.....edit...Thank you again for that thoughtful reply that shows you did not even read my complaint...FAIL...I wish there was a 0 star rating
Food was delayed..looks like opened the rider
👊👊👊👊
Great deal
Excellent
"When I put in the delivery address this app does nothing, no search, no suggestions... Horrible."
2 hour delay for food. They shouldn't accept orders if there are no drivers.
A waste of time. Let's you go through entire order process but When you get to place ordered get told it can't be delivered to my location. Will be deleting app
Good
Very bad app unexpected
"When it works, it's really nice. The worst aspect is having to wait for a driver. The app tells you the amount of time if there are drivers but the fact that good can be prepared and then sit and get cold because a driver hasn't accepted the order is terrible. The app leads you to believe you'll have the order in a certain amount of time but it could be way longer while waiting for a driver."
"Terrible accountability. I waited almost an hour for the restaurant to ""finish my order"" and found that there was no way to speak to anyone about cancelling the order and getting my money back. Uber used to be great about refunding customers if something went wrong. It's a shame that they no longer seem interested in doing so."
"My app will not open. I have updated it, uninstalled it, reinstalled it, & it still will not work"
Easy to use. Great customer service. Highly recommend.
"It has helped me when I have been sick, hungry, tired and depressed by feeding me without the hassle of going out and interact with other people."
Downloaded for the first time. When i enter mobile number or days that my mobile number does not have a password ???
"Sometimes you just need a family pizza brought directly to your drunk ass, you know?"
Can we pay the order using the frimi app?
Great app thanks uber
Excellent app
Disguisting app You cant cancel an order once its placed. So if you accidentally place an order.. There goes your money.. And the foods that arrive are cold af. Two hands down 👎👎
Superb
Good app
"I am a Gold Member and Uber eats completely misreads and misleads me when responding to my requests for help. When they do so and I request more help, they ignore me. Please check the help function in Uber app where I have already submitted all details"
Good
Fast delivery perfect
Love the app
"If you have a problem, they are not helpful. Delivery charges dont make sense. McDonalds just 3 minutes away but it's so far? They have to charge £3.50 delivery"
The only problem I have is all the time the driver go to a different address is somewhere else I have to message the driver for direction
This is asking password which password Dont order in uber eats
Good
"Very bad, cant use the promotions as it keep saying cant use promotion on tbus device and also you can not contact Uvmber eats"
Good service
I cant log in it says i dont have a password. Even trying to reset on a computer doesnt work. Ive logged a query twice and nothing
It's great idea for food delivery
Wonderful experience and fastest delivery. With amazing rewards
العروض والاكواد نصب.. مفيش
It is a very simple to use ride hailing app and works across continents. I wish Uber corrects this feature of clearing the due credit card payment when you want to go about booking the next ride. This is a bit annoying.
Good
Nice app Osm
Fantastic
"the delivery guy was late for 1 hour and called me for more than 20 times for the location! my house is just two houses away from mainroad...like seriously? it was hilarious!!! If u can't give location correctly,can't maintain time and even can't keep professional delivery man,then why u opened the app!?"
Good
Very happy with urber eats
Great app in the world
Fast delivery
"Easy and convenient,no more traffic or q's for food for me.plus i like that the order is sealed"
"What's the point of you sending mea coupon i can't use? I have an Uber ride account but not the Uber Eats one. Ingot a coupon to use for V.day via email. When i applied it its said ``Oops, not eligible for this promotion''? Care to share why?"
Very good 👍
"Laggy logging in, says it will deliver only to go through the order process for it to say it won't deliver to my location"
Annoyed cant seem to buy at any place all g Reyes out and no number to call for help
Sick and tired of the uber driver having to drop multiple orders and then getting cold or soggy food because of it
Very convenient
"I had ordered food online and was waiting for over an hour. I get a message from these guys saying the order was cancelled due to a technical glitch. They waited for an hour to inform me that. And ofcourse if we had cancelled this, they would have charged us a fine but they cancel the order, nothing happens obviously...."
Worst
Love the app
Worst customer service I've ever experienced !
Addicted
Poor service.. Deiliveries always getting delayed...No proper terms with restaurants..!!!
Great app
Stupidest app ever. Can't login ever..
functional app responsive
Simply the best
Xoss app
"No support numbers, their app charge me double order with no way to contact restaurant or uber support. I guess I'll be fat two pizzas for one person. I expect such a big company have at least support to its patrons"
Good
"Sick of ordering food only to get to the end and have my order cancelled or can't be delivered to this area even though they have been here before. Unreliable, clunky and failing. Losing confidence and getting over it."
Crud Don't ever reset your phone if you use this app I've been trying for over a year to get back on Uber eats and I can't get my account logged in because it keeps telling me my email address is already registered so I CANT LOG IN
Terrible service I was delivered the wrong food and they offer a refund in 5 to 7 business days and wont replace the order what is 5 to 7 business days going to do for me
"Still pathetic. wont let me log in saying i dont have a password, furthermore the app doesnt come with any help/support config, ITS A TRASH!"
Works fine.
"Crashes heaps, and often I get to the end of an order and an error message appears saying my location is too far from the store, when I'm less than 1km away and ordered from there a few days prior. Really unreliable app."
Great
I'm trying to sign up as a driver but I dont have a car it won't even allow me to change it and the customer service doesn't help at all it just ended yall could have just been like doordash bro
Good
Excellent!
excellent
Always happy with my meal and delivery is excellent
Good
Good
Not so popular
Garbage
Great
Disgusted not a phone call about a cancelled order
"Update. uber driver just stole my food again, on valentines day. What a bloody debarcle.. if YouTube in melbourne west, never order from these guys. Drivers keep nicking the food. Every order so far I've had to get a refund on"
"Got a error stating ""this email has already been registered"", now what am I supposed to do, couz there is no flipppin log in/sign in option🤦"
Good
I have had so many issues with a few orders I have made and there is no-one to help!!! At least menulog has a contact number and I get the help needed and the refund required!!!
Superb service.It s very easy and convenient.
This app already. Collision to zomato. Ply delete
Count less messed up orders little to no customer care waste of time and effort. I have tried and was banned for reporting missing foods or wrong orders
"Ordering is easy, it's at your finger tips so you don't have to get in the car or waiting in line"
"Order was delayed so driver could make another stop off on the way, to help keep costs down.... food was cold. Waited over 30 minutes to get order, very unhappy, first and last time I will be using uber eats"
"Unsurprisingly, the app is designed to make it difficult to call in a complaint. Additionally, whilenthey push the monthly pass that waives delivery fees - you're no longer able to access restaurants that were further away (that they charged higher delivery fees for). Worse, the restaurants aren't even filtered out of your choices. So if you spent a long chunk of time placing a large order, you only find out you wasted your time AFTER you try placing the order. It's a shameful bait & switch."
👌👌👌
Great
It's very bad now this app present disposal is acquired to zomato what is this
"My mate lives one street over and they get more variety in menu options, and its not like they are close, Wendy's manukau to clendon when will use get more coverage.. still waiting on the up date for more eating locations.."
"Constantly have the issue where drivers will cancel my order. No call, text, or anything and cancel. When I try calling customer service they never have a reason or any ability to actually push a repercussion of any sort for actions like this. Tried ordering again tonight and it had happened making this the 5th time its happened to either me or my wife. Its ridiculous."
"My phone number has changed since i last used uber eats and now i cant log into my account. After trying to sign in with my email only, then trying to create a new account altogether, i just decided to go with menu log instead. Way less hassle and wasnt charged as much in fees."
You cradit number give 1000
Good
😂😂 the price of laziness is high!!! Lol its like 8 dollars in 3 different fees just do one why so many?
This app sucks. The delivery guys steal people's orders. I hate the payment method because your order could be claimed by anyone since the delivery guys don't ask for no proof of identification during order delivery. My order was stolen and I still did not receive any help. Why can't we have a cash or card on delivery payment option?! Seriously. Never ever using it again!
Good app
This app save the time
I only rexieved 2 of my 3 burgers
Love it!!
"Never got the food, and also not getting a refund, do not use this app in costa rica."
Great

Kind of dumb that I cant sign in because my number changed... Response to Uber...Ok will do thanks
"It should tell you how you rated your past orders. I forget, then I order and have the same horrible experience as the first damn time!!!"
It's easy to use and delivery is fast
Not good
"App is very buggy. Tonight, it doubled my order, which was $80! You can't cancel the order if the restaurant accepts it which they do within seconds. I called support immidiately and they put me on hold twice, then told me they were cancelling for me but i was a ""courtesy"" and they wouldn't do it in the future. It isn't a courtesy if your app caused the issue! Very condescending and no apology, this app does not work well and there are better services available."
so quick. I love free deliveries
Love it
Great
Convenient for lazy people who don't cook and keep eating out
Bad
Good
Excellent app to use.
I ordered and was supposed to receive $5 dollars Uber cash and I couldn't find a place to resolve the issue.
No respect on castomar
"i had ordered a mixed meat box which is ADVERTISED with taubli and sliced tomato from ankara kebabs and bakery but only recieved the hot chips and mixed meat no salad, at least with diliveroo they will asssist and organise a credit on your next order but if you have an issue with your order on uber eats they just give you 'will let them know for next time'. so i pay full price and delivery and miss out on half my meal-edit.on website and it's difficult to navigate around 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦 APP DELETED 👎"
Best app for Foods 👍
Amazing and convenient
Great!
Interface is not user-friendly.
"Uber eats is rushing it's drivers and treataning if you will be late your account will be suspended. At the end of the day because bad treatment and work under pressure there are many accidents on the road. Do not forget that Uber doesn't take responsibility for accidents on the road and injuries caused to people. Absolutely horrible conditions to work with uber eats. Uber eats don't asses conditions of roads, traffic and weather properly.. I whish to give negative stars if possible..."
i ordered and the person who was to deliver was going everywhere else except to pick up my order ....the order had been ready for a long while the app started saying that my order was late and they would look into it and i had to cancel because they would of brought my order cold and it wasn't the restaurants fault.
"We just had a big issue with our order. And guess what. Customer service cant help us cause they dont have one. Never ever using this app again. Doordash is way better, cause they actually have a customer service # because they actually care about their customers."
Chevere
"So how am I supposed to log back in from a new phone. A very frustrating experience, getting GrubHub I guess."
"Delivery of unsafe, dangerous foods. Food is cold and soggy, but the cold drinks will be warm. They will charge you full price and expect you to eat the unsafe foods or pay to have an entire new order delivered. They will not refund the unsafe foods you have to throw out . The drivers will deliver to other locations and just drive around with the food getting cold and could care less about it. I have finally had enough and am switching to one of the many other food delivery options."
Awesome
Doesn't let you customize your order.! And the original price for some foods are more than doordash.!
Hidden fees.
Gets me my food.
Food arrived wrong and charged for items not on order ... Spoke to restaurant and they did not recieved full order from app
"Used to be good, Too many extra fees added"
Bloody can't even place an order here
Very fast delivery experience!
The biscuit is dry and I didn't get my extra biscuit I ordered. I was not given any sauce to eat with the chicken
"Too many glitches and lack of communication between uber, restaurants, and customers."
Uber eats is the worst. Had 30 bucks in my card. Some random delivery driver stole my food and cancelled the order. Now the 30 bucks i had to pay wil sstay in process for 2 weeks before a refund and i dont have money for food. Just fantastic.
Worst customer service experience imaginable
It's a very good app.
"Great delivery, good food choices and very convenient. Always trust Uber Eats to get my order right and delivered."
Frustrating
Wow!
So so nice
Delivery and service charges are high
Great service!
"No bug reporting option, the user interface doesnt scale with my phone (galaxy a5 2017) so I can't order any alcohol. Also, theres a tip before and after on the ordering options. I think that's wierd. Tip once, after. That's how deliveries work."
"Very good food, fast drop off and lovely delivery people I love this app"
"Used once, took ages to get delivered and was cold. Just tried again and service unavailable"
UberEats overcharged me I called customer service and they will not return my money.
Excellent app
"It is not uncommon to be missing items no matter what restaurant you ordered from. Tonight was the final straw. The driver left our meal on somebody else's front porch. They didn't even hand it to a person. When Uber was contacted all they would finally offer was a refund within 3-7 business days. That didn't even come with in ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience""."
"Thus is more about how the app assigns deliveries rather than the app itself. I constantly get cold and soggy food because the app always assigns a bicycle to deliver my food, often the rider will also make another delivery along the way. It always takes upwards to an hour to receive my food, at which point is barely worth the wait and money. PLEASE give us an option to disable BICYCLE deliveries. I'd happily pay extra to get a car that comes straight to me."
Nice
"It's not ""THE PERFECT APP"" but it was a good option when I ordered a little portion of sushi and sometimes there are some interesting promotions// Não é perfeito, mas foi apresentou uma qualidade e custo-benefício satisfatório na minha opinião. Recomendo dar pelo menos uma chance"
Useful app. Especially when you need help after surgery to feed your family. Thank you.
I just love the flexibility of this app. Not having to drive around Seattle. Just going out my door. Picking up my perfectly delivered food. How much better can It get?
"Simple to use app, McDonald's doesn't always have the hours they are closed.!"
"poor user interface, looks good at the start, but when you try to use gift cards or vouchers. You may find it's a rubbish app"
Biriyani
Too expensive.
"I've been using UBER EATS for over a year, on average once a week, sometimes more & the only problems tend to have been the food, (a handful of times) & only once with the delivery person. Each time Uber Eats have very quickly given me a refund for the appropriate portion of the order, so no complaints when reporting a complaint. The one thing I'd like to change is I wish the cost of the food/meal was the same via the app as it is when bought in store, especially as we pay extra for delivery"
App couldn't find a diver for my order so I had cancel it
Worst company ever
Terrible!
If u dont pay attention y'all get us for that tip. Paying more than what u wanted to.
"Terrible servicio. En mi caso después de poner la dirección equivocada marqué a soporte inmediatamente y me dijeron que no pueden cambiarla, pero se comunicarían con el repartidor ya que se encontraba dentro del rango del restaurante PERO que dependía totalmente del repartidor. El repartidor puso que entregó y soporte manda que ellos no pueden hacer nada. Si quieren tirar el dinero y no tener ningún tipo de garantía instalen esta aplicación."
Love it
Cancels my orders without my approval with no compensation for my loss of time. I can't reccomend this application again.
When I is hangry uber eats save everyone around me
This app is garbage. I can't even reset my password. Every time I get an email do reset my password then it says you do not have authorization for this web page. I am being forced to give it 1 star. If I could I'd give it Zero.
Uber has done it again! Best food ordering platform I have used. LOVE that I can change the tip amount after delivery if needed/deserved.
Great service... Only had two bad experience
Took over an hour to get a driver to driver my food and when it got here most of my order was missing and I can't get in contact with anyone to fix it. Will not be using this app again.
There is no means provided to remove any of your payment information. Is that legal??? There is a description in the 'help' section advising to tap the wallet icon. Well there is no wallet icon. Very deceitful business practice.
Worrest customer serve ever
Terrible service. Twice now I have got a discount to use on my first order and neither time has it worked. I still have not made a first order. Deceiving and it's also impossible to get in touch with them.
Always reliable drivers. Friendly
Easily useable
"Sempre uma confusão nas entregas, quando não levam mais de 30 minutos pra vir de bicicleta."
La aplicación es muy buena.
Good app but delivers a little expensive
"I saw their reply on feb 13, I DID sent back info to support team...that's when they stopped answering me.Got the ""invalid phone number"" error message. Contacted support, did not suggest anything I hadn't already try, no word from them since. Very slow to answer and not really helpful. For an app that deals with sensitive informations (address,phone number & credit card info) they have poor judgment regarding how they manage your data. No hotline, no real support. weak!"
"Fantastic for truck drivers, stranded on the on the side of the road."
Is coo
Dont have to leave and get food
Wow I never thought I could love so deeply and fully
It was fast easy and i was able to surprise my love thanks
"Absolute garbage, Impossible to register, DOG SHITE"
"This app is great dont get me wrong I've ordered on it loads of times. But recently I redownloaded the app. (it's up to date) there is no option on the first page to sign in my account, there is only an option to ""get started with uber eats""(create an account) I've defiantly looked the entire page theres nothing there apart from that with the option to put your phone number in (to create an account) which I did try and it recognised my email but just says that I'm already registered."
Placed a 50.00 order and got my food 2 hours later. Asked for refund and was told no
P download a little bit slow
"I have an issue with the login . Every time I put my number, appears an error says""your account doesn't have a password"" can you please fix this or at least tell me how to use you app? Thanks in advance"
Support is less than useless and not very helpful. I have made a mistake on a order which I was allergic to and I tried to contact support but their system didn't recognise my number. Then it was delivered I tried to contact support I waited on the line for 20 minutes and they said to use the app to get help as the order was delivered. I did do what they said but I but the said to make a new order and was useless. I never going to use uber eats ever again. Uninstalled
"Food frequently shows up LATE and COLD. The prices on uber have an upcharge and often cost more than they would if you visited the store. And let's not forget delivery and service fees. Not to mention by the time I get my food, my lunch break is already over because they are super late 80% of the time. And uber does nothing to compensate you for the delay, or the poor food quality. They just say ""take advantage of our rating system"". Absolute WASTE of MONEY. Use GrubHub or Postmates."
Easy
"Be careful!!!!! They double charge!!!!! I don't know how to reply to your comment, Uber. I will write it here. First, you don't have any customer service e-mail or phone. The only e-mail I found told me to solve the problem through the app. The person in the app justified the payments I did with one credit card and never answered to why did you charge me unreasonable amounts to the other. So... the same day, I ate 6 times for a total amount of almost 80 euros. Yes, sounds reasonable."
Its a great app
Always good and if any problems gets sorted straight away
Excellent app!!
Good
Great app
Thank you Uber Eats for making it right when the restaurant miss or mess up an order
Haven't used this app in awhile & now i realize why i liked it in the first place! Fantastic service !!
Awful the 3 days rubbing order food it was perfect but today the messed up twice 1st one they never came here and the secon he said he can find where I am I have to go out and the Parking Lot so I can see him he did know what I'm talking about I'm trying to splain to him hes nervous he go like hyper Not happy at all I end up eating at 3 o'clock
It doesn't recognise any of my emails what the hell?? How I'm I supposed to reregister if I can not get any help
"Absolutely useless, won't accept my card, charged my partner $70 and then did not deliver, now refuses to open."
"The pickup function is state of the sht, onece the order placed, I cannot find the address of the restaurant, had to call the restuarant when I arrived at a shady alley. Also why can't you let customers to sort results by distances? Let your outsourced developers know that please"
Terrible service waited more than an hour then order was canceled
Brilliant
The delivery car icon doesn't appear in the tracking map.
"Service keeps getting worse and worse, Minimum charges have been increased from 10$ to 15$s. Essentially making all orders cost more than 20$s at all times. Completely outrageous that I end up paying 24$s for a 12$ meal. At this rate I'll give up on using the service entirely. I'm willing to pay a bit extra for convenience but this is just robbery."
Good service 👌
"It's toxic, I downloaded it for the first time and entered my phone number after adding my country and it kept saying ""Something went wrong."", I'm so unsatisfied with Uber Eats."
Rubbish app keeps freezing and wont let me order freezes after youve put all order through
I literally just did this.
"Easy to use,Gives a variety"
"Food came early, very courteous delivery people, I am on crutches."
Everytime when I want to make an order it says my order can not be processed..... Can I please get help on that... I've never used it before because of this
I love Uber eats! Definitely an easy and helpful app!
Awesome
Not worth
Great app
This never really works...
Got all that I ordered this time and the driver was very nice
Good
When item wasnt available the app malfunctions
Been using this app for about a week. Very happy with the easy and fast service.
Excellent
"Hi I have an error while get started with uber app. The error is "" your account doesn't have a password"". Pls help to rectify"
Been good to me every time I use it
Usefull
Excellent
Love it
Very convient for people that only get 30 min lunches. Thank you
Primeiro cupom bom
Took way to long
Ive been trying to install it for over an hour and still cant get it to complete
Too hard to get reimburse for bad quality food.
It was my first and it went smoothly i so do it again with tip next time
I cant verify my payment deleted and readmitted and still no use
I'd give it 0 stars if I had the option.
Ml L mm Ok mm L L ml Vc can ..hg
"So uber eats has been good overall for someone working on the road but as I just found out... if your driver that is bring your food decides not to deliver your food, uber eats is like all well here is your money back try again with a different driver maybe it will work out better this time. Doing nothing to make it right by their customers. Dont expect hot food all the time either. Normally warm to cold because drivers will not only be taking your food and everyone elses at the same time."
و الله رائع
Good
I can't open the app after downloading uber eats. It say my account has no password and i do have uber account
I like food
"I like the app, it's reliable and I very much appreciate the people that deliver the order when they should be delivered, but sometimes it would be off coordination with the map and will end up confusing you and the person picking up your order (s). The app should get a few more updates to make sure nothing goes wrong."
Wonderful
Give me cheaper deals
"Placed an order at 9 pm and my delivery kept getting delayed. Called the restaurant and they said ""the food is ready but uber is not sending a driver for some reason"" so I tried to use the support system. At 7 am they finally message me back and ask me if i want the order at that time. Not only I was charged for that order and they fail to recognize that, yesterday they charged me an additional 27 dollars for no reason. STAY AWAY from this app."
Please at least let your users to cancel orders more easily!!I just can't cancel my order
horrible customer service- poor communication
Horrible. How are you going to use my location and tell me you cant find my address. Wow I uninstalled this immediayely. Grubhub it is.
Great and fast
I'm very disappointed that you don't deliver in my area even though there are so many restaurants nearby. Literally all of them are 10 mins away from my neighborhood. Please fix this because it's so convenient to have uber eats when you don't feel like cooking or driving to get takeout. I love this app. I don't want to be disappointed.
So far sooo good
Poor payment option. U cannot pay via cash without having to verify yourself first. Which you have to put your card details.
Good
This is a very good app and more offers.... but I gave 1 rating bcoz u have joined with zomato the worest app is ZOMATO
Курьер украл заказ))) Убер даже не сделал ничего Courier has stolen my order. Uber did nothing
Perfect food delivery app
I'd like to give it less stars if possible. Uninstalled the app. Download it again. Now it doesn't work. Negative stars.
Mr burger a xtra kono tax add kore na eta shobai jane bt apnader akhane eta kora hochse.. 330 takar item a discount die 260 kore abar 60+tax nichsen so ultimately no discount...
"They show you promotional offer and you order food like ""order 1 get free"". They deliver just 1 of 2 - turns out that ordered food is not in offer! But they don't give any info on what is in offer and what is not🤷🏼‍♀️ nice first impression..."
Try and get more restaurant and please ask the delivery guy to speak properly
"The promos sent never work. Soon as I try to use it, it shows cannot be added? Then why send it to me?"
Soooo Good
Super Convenient!
"I use to love this app so much! It had amazing options. But why would this app get acquired by zomato! It was such a heartbreak. Uber eats was the best, it has no comparison"
", വേറെ"
Wow
"Always good,except for one occasion when food arrived ice cold to my door. I totally forgot to mention it to the place concerned. In general a fantastic convenient way to order in if you dont feel like getting in your car."
"This fee, that fee, every excuse to charge you more. Not to mention most of the time the delivery guy is a crazy toxic flake and not at all friendly. One time this black guy picked up my food, took a detour away from my home parked somewhere for like 10 minutes, probably to blaze one up. Seemed anal when he arrived simply because i asked him to come to the back door cause i cant hear the front door. It was barely worth it even when the service was really cheap. Im not paying for attitude."
Only thing worst then uber currently is uber eats
No se puede aplicar las promociones.
Always great service
"Easy to use, and does what needs to be done."
Good
V.good and fast
Awesome and helpful.
This Fake. It take all your info and ask to Signup in Zomato. Fake and Spam.
Nice
Nice service nice 🍴🍕🍔food
Worst app it is not downloading
Super
Very bad. Commitment is very bad.
Very bad When the app was giving the promotional off.. So i ordered from a restaurant.. But then the resturent called me and told it was far from my zone.. So he us canceling the order. Oky.. but why uber charge it from my account.. It wasn't me who cancelled it. So why i had to pay for it
"Worst app ever! I mistakenly ordered and wanted to cancel the order, but this worst app didn't even gave me an option for that! Plus it didn't had any contact number by which we could contact the customer service! Don't use it guys worst app ever!"
Bad apps Its bad
Super
"Very bad support experience. One of my orders had missing items, support said I would get a refund but it never arrived. Furthermore, the only way to get support is through the app or webpage, no support phone. So, if you don't get your order right, buy something else to it anywhere else (for example, Just Eat) because you won't get help instantly, if you manage to get help... Overall, very bad experience. I would recommend Just Eat a thousand times over Uber Eats."
Resourceful
It was nagging to put here something so I did.
Amazing
"Extremely offended. Account was suspended just because I called out merchants for continously getting orders wrong, even when I provide picture proofs of the wrong orders."
"Be prepared to wait a long time to receive your food. If you cancel for waiting too long, they will still charge your account for food you never received."
"Worst app, trying to link us with zomato !!"
Still love this App but we definitely need it in Wanganui. I love this App for when our family travels. saves me driving in fast traffic and it's just soooo easy.
Great
The process of ordering here is so diplomatic and disturbing why Uber eats provide those promotion if is not validate
"I don't understand why you are pushing update of this app.B'Coz when we open uber app it's say that ""go to zomato""."
Bad
Nice app
Awesome
App is good but less restraurants. Poor customer support and service
Hard to use
"Garbage Interface. Impossible to give an accurate location. It won't allow me to pick my location from a map. Edit: ""...an option of pin-pointing... on map"" There is no such option. Edit2: Here's a solution. Go into the Uber Ride App, add a Favorite Place in your account. That tool does have the ""pick my location from a map"" feature. Once you set it up in the Uber Ride App, then it's available as a favorite location on the Uber Eats App. You have a UX problem there. Edit3: Dear customer support. You keep suggesting the same solutions that do not work. There is no ""option of pin-pointing your delivery address on the map"". Try it yourselves before answering back. Try it out on the latest Uber Eats Android version. To give the full details I have Uber Ride and Uber Eats on the same phone and with favorite locations saved at Uber Ride. Somehow I think this is where your BUG is. But for God's sake, test it out before answering. I followed your instructions and there is no option to pin point. Also, read Edit2 for the only workaround I found."
"4.99 for delivery, when shop is down the road, total rip off, i could have caught a cab in uber cheaper"
我用手機的網路在打排名遊戲。訂餐過幾分鐘一直被打來，每次打來我斷線。我一直掛，他們一直打來。 一。直。打。來。 我就接說我現在不能接。結果？繼續打來。聽不懂國語嗎？你們不知道什麼是uber裡面的簡訊系統嗎？ 結果是餐廳賣完了。我當然跟他們說直接取消。但是你們打來一定要像賣完了就等於世界末日嗎？Wtf。 btw 我那場當然輸了，謝謝ubereats。
👌🏿😋
Depends who delivers has 2 hour wait before and foods been here in 10 mins
No experience
It is good however prices are a bit much
Telling to download Zomato🙃😡
"I am a regular customer, but lately my orders have been cancelled and arrived past estimated time, the delivery cost has gone up and the so called points system! I'm gold at the moment and it's confusing?! No discount on orders... Oh and also I can't even download the app on a different cell phone number!!! Same email but changed number and it won't let me renew the uber app unless I confirm it on old cell phone number😒 (which I dont have) nevermind the email address or security questions ffs"
Awesome app
🌷🌷
USELESS fool uber is in tie with zomato... asks me to install zomato to order
When you login without the app it only takes you to previous orders and it only lets you reorder what you have orderd before and it tells you you are to far away
Server error
It's really fantastic app
Quite Dissappointed. Mainly because it is not available in Tanzania! :(
Excellent
Above average
Terrible charged me and didnt even deliver my food
能選擇的店家很少，希望能在地圖裡顯示更多參與商家
Love this app. It's convenient
Great
Am really not happy with the driver's at all... Its either they not clean or they Jst have a funny smell... Makes a person lose appetite
Easy and intuitive.
Very good
Fantastic app. So easy.
Awesome
Ordered food to be picked up by myself from subway which is about a 5 minute walk got there they informed me that an uber eats driver had left with my food so i walked back home waited outside in cold for Uber driver after 15minutes subway called and informed me that uber driver had returned my food to restaurant and that i could walk back to restaurant and pick up food that should have never left with driver so food was taken handled and foodnapped fgor 15minutes uber help was no help at all
Convenient and good local selection
Awesome
I never really had a problem with the app. I love the 'Free Delivery' feature.
Bad options
Amazing
all i want is mcdonalds and there is a few in my area one being a 5 min drive and it isnt on uber eats for me. :(
l cant log in for nw plz help
I am not able to order it is redirecting me to zomato. Reply Uber
Fast delivery but on top of charging for delivery they inflate the prices of every item. 1 veggy footlong sub is a fiver from subway... Uber wants 7.60. outrageous!-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_--_-_- In response to Ubers response-im not arguing the delivery fee I understand that. You charge more for every menu item than the restaurant does as well as charge for delivery
This App is Not work in india
"I used it for a very short time. It was great since I could track my orders and I always received my food on time. My Uber account was closed, therefore, I cannot use Uber nor Uber Eats. Well, let's stick to a different app."
When you get to the page where it says about not delivering to schools it doesn't scroll up so you can click on that statement. This has happened twice to me now 😥
The most retarded app
Easy to use. Reordering is easy. Things are easy to find. It's all good really.
Very good.
"Horrid customer service. Seriously, I lost £15 because the driver never showed up, but said he made the delivery. When I asked for a refund I was told no basically because they've refunded me in the past. They went on to threaten to deactivate my account and basically said they didn't have to explain why they made their decision in the first place."
Amazing & efficient
FOOD!!!
Please start your service again zomato DNT give discount like Uber eats
"Why dont u guyz say , we have to download zomoto to order food..wasting time and data"
Good
Eggselent
"Works well very few problems, but the solutions are always easy"
Good
Drivers are hopeless
The orders are late
this is really ridiculous. they aren't giving me the 50% discount on first 2 orders. whats wrong man. beside this is really an amazing app.
Great for when your starubvjng after a long shift but just want to get home and not cook anything.
Awesome
Very worst app
"Great idea ,just finished work I'm hungry order and then gets delivered awesome ."
My account got locked
Driver allocations terrible. Convenience great
No good deals anymore
Ja it's not bad hey.
Good app overall.
EASY and SMART
Worst delivery app in the world. Avoid at all costs delivery guy marked my order as delivered even though he failed to deliver it. Was a nightmare trying to get refunded. Never again will I use this app.
Your account doesn't have a password!! 😡😡🤬🤬🙏🙏
Why did you closed the services ?
Too much Vat and delivery charge... totally unfair
"Horrible company, they are thieves who should be ashamed of themselves. Never ordering from them again. I placed an order of 140 dollars and they brought me food that was cold and unsatisfying. I felt bad throwing out so I reheated it. Still didn't taste good. I asked for a refund but they claim their policies don't allow refunds but they are just cheating people out of their money for the mistakes they make. I would be embarrassed to work for such an organization."
Makes easier for me to get food 🍲 even when I'm in a tight spot.
Awesome
app easy to follow.. everything delivery correct.. timing perfect
Works great! More Free delivery options would be nice.
"This app will not update based on your current location. Considering that the Uber app will do so, this is a significant oversight on the part of there development team. I've wasted money submitting an order under the assumption that the app would update for my current location."
"Was good before, but there's no way to contact cs on the app, so at times like now, when my food keeps getting delayed, i have no way to find out what is going on. No numbers to call and when i email, says the email is not monitored. Download deliveroo instead."
Good good
Works well
It's ok
Crappie delivery
On time
The drivers suck. Food is always cold when Delivered. Would not recommend. As someone that works for the restaurants the company delivers for I can assure you they never come on time and will deliver you cold food. They sometimes take over 2 hours to come get the food in Plattsburgh NY. Will never recommend anyone use this service. You want fresh hot food just go to the restaurants yourself. Save the over priced delivery fees as well.
👍
Fantasic! Best app ever
10-Oct
good app
Love it
Just got a double up order and charged for two. Not happy
Nothing working
At least ring the doorbell to let people know you're here!
Good app very useffull
Why is uber eats asking me to order from zomato?
Order took too long. Driver waited 15 minutes. Food was cold.
"Worth the convenience, haven't had too many issues and nothing major. Drive safe y'all!"
Compared with iOS app. Android app has a lag.
Great experience so far
It's very easy to navigate between different options
so much better than skip 🤣
"Apesar da praticidade, ultimamente sinto que a qualidade do serviço está caindo. Pedidos vem atrasando bastante; as vezes até sendo cancelados após deixar meia hora como ""preparando""; tive duas ocorrências de pedir algo em promoção ""compre 1 e leve 2"" e veio apenas 1 lanche, e quando abri uma reclamação sobre um desses casos, de início a UberEats me disse que o pedido não estava dentro da promoção, aí tive de mandar um print pra comprovar que estava sim na promoção. Estou decepcionado."
Its good but alot of hidden fees. They should dispay the total cost (besides tip) up front
I cancel a order as soon as I ordered it I changed my mind and went to the restaurant instead. I get my credit card statement uber charged me the full price. I went to the Restaurant and they said the order was canceled. So they didn't prepare the ordered. But uber eats charged me full price for the order. I call uber and they said that the order was processed and they would not even give me a credit on my uber account.
A good app to get food when your lazy 👍
You are feeding me. Thank you.
Great app never have issues with it highly reccommend.
Very easy to use. Little more expensive than getting it yourself. But cheaper than DUI!!!
Luv it
The addition to service charges and small order charge is disappointing and the main reason I am giving the app 4 stars and not 5. Customer service and refunds on incorrect orders is usually easy. Large number of restaurants and select variety.
Cool
Very easy and intuitive to use
Excellent experience!
Easy to use App.
Grest
The app is great! It's the drivers that dont know how to follow directions.
不能打統編
Good
Awesome....
When you too lazy to cook you can still eat like a king/queen.
BEST APP EVERY
"I got a gift card for Uber Eats for Christmas and I made an account just to use the money, but when I tried to use it, there was no payment option for me to use it with, now I have to Actually cook something. Thanks Uber."
"easy, fast and very convenient"
"When you order from subway, uber eats leaves out alot of toppings and sauces for your sub. Uber eats is kind of pricey but worth it when the weather is crappy and you don't want to cook."
Expect cold food delivered two hours after order
"My order never arrived and they kept us waiting 1.5 hours. Its hard to get in touch on call and get the update. You have to keep calling Uber, Restaurant and Driver. Finally we all had to go out for dinner. There are better apps which always work."
Enjoy it
Excellent service
"I've tried them all, Foodora, Just Eats, but Uber Eats is still my ""go-to""."
Fantastic on cold days when you don't want to cook or go out.
Ecellent app so easy to use
"My order was placed to another state. I immediately called to cancel but the customer service was so incompetent, the food came before he can do anything. Terrible experience."
"Varios pedidos llegan mal, si pagas con tarjeta se demoran más de una semana en hacerte el reembolso, si es en efectivo exigen el pago del pedido completo independiente de que si llego todo o no osea que si tú pedido era de 50 y lo que faltó equivalen 30 pierdes eso hasta el próximo en cambio rappi te hace el ajuste inmediato además de que el domiciliario se enoja con uno por no querer pagar algo que no esta, no es culpa de él ni culpa de uno pero bue..."
"Son unos ladrones, aparentemente no tienen forma de saber que paso con una orden o no les interesa, me cobraron una orden que nunca llegó, ni cerca a mi casa, sin embargo ellos indican que el delivery me espero por más de 10 minutos, cuando nunca deje de monitorear el trayecto del pedido."
"It's ok needs more options and discounts, and also needs better clarification on ordering cause idk how my orders be in group rides and I pay for express orders.... Yes I definitely will tell you about it. I ordered from A fast food restaurant thinking I'm going to get my order in a good time but instead they put my order in a sharing a ride when I didn't want that and my order came late and the food was very cold and tasteless this happen a couple times as well."
"Delivery guys wont contact you and cancel, keeping your money that was charged with Uber being unwilling to assist or at least refund. Don't use this."
Hold these restaurants accountable!
Rubbish.. can't get past email address as says email address already been used but then there is no option to go past this stage
Very easy to use
They show restaurants tgat are not available. You call suppirt and they do not listen to the issue. They are great at apologizing but not really providing an answer. Door Dash is easisr to work with.
"The app works fine but all the stupid fees they charge doesnt make it worth ordering food. Im going to uninstall as of today. Service fee, delivery fee, something else fee, tax, tip, and dont forget the small order fee, NEWS FLASH i just need enough food for myself not a whole house so why are you charging me for not buying enough youre already taking a service fee.. Im done using this app until its worth my money again"
After following instuctions to load a gift card to uber eats my $50 balance doesnt show up.
"Was hungry, now im not"
Always comes in handy when I can't leave work !
Top rated food delivery app
Love the built-in navigation. Better than Google Maps
"Good for when you want something besides pizza but it's prohibitively expensive. On top of delivery & service fees, there's an extra fee for orders under $15 (until recently it was $10). The user has no control over who the delivery person is, yet app doesn't always find the best match (i.e.large order given to someone on bike). So service can be unreliable. You can end up paying a lot of $$$ for not a lot of food & unpredictable service.There's cheaper, more reliable options for ordering out"
This is the Worst food app i ever use i don't recommend to noone they did not deliver my food at all and when i ask for my money back they don't even answer . Ussles
Awesome app.
So far so good
"I never used the app but says my number is claimed by another account and there is no help option or ""not me"" blah blah blah....."
This is mt 2nd time ordering first order was 20 min past est delievry. So i am giving them another try
Love it
Very good
Easy to use!
GREAT SERVICE!
Best way to grab a meal in your area without leaving the house. Needed it in my life.
Always Fast... And almost always accurate. Food never tampered with... And respectful drivers👌🏾💪🏾👍🏾
I like it!
"Works well. A bit feature busy eg I don't want ""recommendations"". Smells more like ""marketing"". Ads severly detract from the order process by distraction"
Ordering online is an imperfect science to a lot of local places. Uber eats totally eliminates me worrying if I accidentally just ordered six pizzas instead of one because the local shop's website is a little janky
Amazing spectacular
Trash customer service . Food was 40 mins late and ice cold wouldn't issue refund. ..in response to yours I did . You sent someone to deliver my food on a bike .. in a blizzard .and you told me tokick rocks basically
Mishap with a previous order
"Polite drivers, excellent service..."
Very verrry very bad
Love this for my family
Best delivery app...and I've tried all of the top delivery apps. The others could learn from Uber Eats...😏
"Constantly fails, especially with promos."
"DO NOT USE unless you want to be ripped off!! The food will arrive cold. The delivery will miss items you've ordered/deliver wrong items and they will refuse to return your money, which leaves you paying for items you never received and in effect paying for items you didn't order. When things work, it's fine (like anything else), but if things are wrong, get ready for frustration, poor service, paying for wrong items ordered and getting blanket replies."
"Very nice app, they use to give more discount now its only 30÷ but menos da una piedra."
"Horrible timing, it has taken well over 40 min then the indicated time of delivery. Service charge is outrageously high."
Best
Proper
Uber eat I have lot my SIM and number but I remember the email and password and how would i get back on it . how do i change my number but I haven't loged in to any uber eat apps. Plz reply
"This app is easy to use, food delivered timely and hot. The drivers are courteous and friendly. I changed from another app to this one."
Really enjoyed it so much
Nice
"I had some bad experience with this app,sometimes when you want to place an order they will tell you you have an outstanding payments,that you do not know of and if u dont settle it they can't place your order. It happened twice,1st time I paid because I urgently needed food at the time but made a follow up with them to credit my money back and they did,this time around I'm not going to pay any money I do not know of.I'd rather uninstall this app."
Tried 4 different phones - cannot create account. Never rely on uber to get food Update: please delete my account
I will never use anything from Uber ever again. There fees are too high and then when an order is messed up they do not correct the situation.
Great App and lots of amazing offers.
"Easy to use, fast delivery"
"Increíble que al mediodía con el afán de regresar a la oficina y después de esperar una hora, cancelen el pedido por un error responsabilidad de ellos"
Very useful at times!
It's pretty much good
Excellent
Terrible and pathetic apparently I already have an account when I clearly don't and a restaurant 2 Mike's down the road is too far of a journey 😂😂😂😂 pathetic get it sorted out
Love it
"It doesn't even download. I find this problem, with all the food apps."
Horrible
Awesome sauce
The worst app ever! they deducted money off my account and refuse to reimburse me with it... so i would suggest not to download this app.
Best way you don't need to drive even
"Currently I'm getting a blank screen looking for my location then saying it's unavailable, I've restarted the app as well as my phone and nothing works"
It wont let me make and a new account and i try are the ones i know.
Quick delivery and easy to order from a variety of restaurants.
Best in town!
Gud
Smooth
"Worst system ever, in Brazil iFood is better than uber eats for miles away"
Disgusting customer service.
Great so far
I love uber eats but it's a shame that they don't deliver to me anymore
"Very poor customer support. Two of the item I ordered was missing, and I had to contact customer support 3 times, First time they only refunded one of the item even when I said 2 of the item was missing, and then the next 2 times they told me that there is nothing more they could do about my other missing item. Very disappointed, do not recommend anyone use this service since there is no refund if they make a mistake."
"While this app is more expensive than others, it does give further dining options. However, the delivery cost and fees will make you lose your appetite"
Very good
Annoying me too much
Dumbest app ever
"Its good app overall, there are just sometimes lot of places become unavailable."
Wont let me place order says verify payment but my card is on there and I know damn well there is money on it .. so
Ruim!
I dislike delivery fees
"Not technically a experiance, (sorry i can't spell). I have a question, if you can answer it. Can you pay with real life cash? :) Asking cause i have no creditcard. I'll put the review star thing when I a answer."
I have no complain... When i do they fix it real quick
Love There Pizza They Are The BEST
"More than 1 time now, received coupons through sms and email and did not work"
Worst system ever if a promo given to the customer please apply the promo to your system also whem the customer place it..otherwise rider does not knw the promo that the customer placed🤬
Good
Delivery on time...
Nice
The app works pretty good the only downside to it is their delivery drivers. I have had multiple orders show up that are wrong or missing parts or just gave me the wrong order because the drivers do not understand how to read English. I'm not saying this in a degrading. It makes it difficult for them to do their job right when they can't verify the information because of a language barrier.
"Very easy to use. Perfect for lunch at work, and late nights... Love it."
Not reliable
ME COBRARAM UM VALOR INDEVIDO!!!!!!
"Pésimo servicio, quitaron el contacto por teléfono para quejas, además de que prácticamente ya no aceptan pago en efectivo..."
Great service!
Why dont you takedown the app ???
Very bad app
Good
I placed my order at 7:22 pm. The restaurant could not get a driver. The restaurant said a half an hour. They kept updating me. The update came in that they will deliver around 9pm. I was on lunch and less than a mile away but could not leave work. I had to cancel the order after waiting 1and one half hours. The cancellation charge to my credit card was over 11 dollars. Not my fault. The thing I wonder is did my sandwich wait that long and who got to eat my sandwich? I will not use them.
"After several years, still no real service in the ACT. All the restaurants they advertise have online ordering through their website, those that don't you can get through phone. There is no point to this app in the ACT."
Not easy apps like as others
"Works well in gauteng. However, did not work too well in Cape town. it could have been a problem at the restaurant"
Uber eats come back again?
Service is good
Nice
"Fast, always to date nothing missing, great service"
I have installed the uber eats app and the app is not opening and it is asking me to install Zomato. When i want to order in zomata i might have install zomato only
Professionally good but customer satisfaction is not completely satisfied
Mutch better than theapp inside the uber main app
Good
"Great Service, Thank you Uber Eats..."
I am not able to open Uber eats it is written that connect with zomato
Adequate
I have ordered many and happy memories... But the service of customer care is worst
"Despite being linked to the Uber app, where I have no payment issues, the app repeatedly states that there are insufficient funds in my account when this isn't the case. This takes time to check and has caused me some embarrassment."
Fast delivery and nice drivers
Super good
"Catered to the lazy, this app makes it so you pay double what you would if you would jusr go into the store yourself. Enjoy your 20 dollar burgers.. that arrive not fresh and lack that picture perfect look"
"Experience of this app:it gives you exactly want you want ,but shop about at all times"
Uber Eats is awesome and always super quick to help sort out any issues. Uber support is always responsive and I always end up a satisfied customer.
I just downloaded the updated version today and now I am unable to delete any of my old payment details as everytime I click on it the three dots appear for a second and then disappear from the screen this is really frustrating can you please help me with this issue as I am I really need to delte the information
Nice service.
I can't log in by my phone number. It says try again but no use. Worst app ever
Good

Not Install In My Phone Why ?

"It's pretty straightforward. Also, in the event a mistake is made with my order I'm not expected to pay for an item I didn't receive nor want."
Good
"Brilliant app. Superfast delivery, low cost food. Overall perfect app for food delivering"
"Easy to use, versatile and focused in what it does"
ok
Wow!! Super fast delivery
"i don't recognise my email address, so i don't open my uber eats's account with my phone number. what will i do?? please suggest me"
Uber Eats is by far the best. Many more options than the rest.
"Was amazing it have had my account suspended from too many refunds, I have requested like 5 refunds over the last 6 months due to part of the order being incorrect, non of my refunds request where full refunds, I have tried to open the chat support but it's either unclear or just not there as an option (definitely the second one) I have open a support inquiring but no one has contacted back"
this app awesome ❤✔
Try to reset password and it just goes around in circles.
"Application nulle, je veux payer avec la carte ticket resto et l'app ne me dit pas si le payement a bien été effectué. Du coup je vois que mon compte bancaire a été débité aulieu de la carte ticket resto alors que l'option pour payer avec était bien cochée. Impossible d'annuler la commande vu que le resto accepte ma commande dans la seconde. C'est la deuxième fois que ça arrive je desinstalle cette application complètement inutile."
Not always drink option
من اساس ما توصلون لكل المناطق.. منطقتي وما جاورها غير مخدومة
Very efficient and fast delivery
Ubereats is a great app and absolutely love it. I think they can create surveillance whilst the driver drops of the food to ensure that people don't pay twice or hey schemed. I paid. Ash for my order and even gave the driver a tip. He didn't report that I paid. That made me very angry as a valued customer.
Good
"Used the service this morning, order was wrong things missing and damaged. Got in touch with the ""support"" team to report the issue and basically got f***ed off a measly refund which didn't even come close to the cost of the items that I reported. Wouldn't even give it a star for the level of service if it wasn't for the fact you have to to be able to post review."
Excellent app I wouldn't be without it and very convenient. Thank you.
Thx for the service
We miss you in India... Please Comeback
Great
"Your app works, your service is criminal. After reporting a fast food place for forgetting to pack all my items, I cant go back to rate them. You simply remove the rating option for some reason. So you leave a customer with 2 options: Rate the company bad OR Report it and get your money back You dont leave users with the option of informing other users of a problem after they get a refund."
"We made an order and it came with some missing items, we tried to reach uber eats support, sent them a picture with all the items that we received and didn't get contacted or refunded. Edit: after a while they reviewed my complain and gave back the money spent on the food, thanks for not take off the money from the deliverer since he did his job and was the restaurant fault."
Excellent service
Its not getting installed on my android
Even im installing this app its taking me to zomato again so who do i even have to install this app.Full waste
Excellent
"They have internal policies which deny you of refunds but wont tell you what they are, so you pay for cold and food that takes an hour to arrive."
I'm taking more time because I need to order Muffin with double sausage and egg and it's difficult for me to do that.
The app is easy to use.
It's a nice 👌 app
Great
I am constantly having to wait 2+ hours before my orders get canceled because no driver will accept my order and I cant cancel it myself with out having to pay still... this app needs to have a way that if it gets past the last expected time of delivery to be able to be canceled by a customer with out a charge to their account or to cancel automatically.
Fix the McDonald's fold over meal selection
🤷🏽❤
Awesome app . I love it 😊
Very good application with good promotion
I need to say what cool drink I want twice in a meal and still get charged for it.
😁
Can you pay cash with this app?
Good services
Stupid app doesn't deliver to any blady address I use
Can't even make an account you useless application
"can't continue! It says ""your account doesn't have a password"". How to register then?"
Nyc
Previously it was good.. But what happened with the app now? Why can't I log in?
"I ordered a burger, and there was no meat in it. I didn't pay $10 for two pieces of bread. So I went online and let uber eats know what happened so they could ask them to idk send some patties my way but it's been ages and now my foods cold. So now I'm sad, hungry and broke. EDIT: reply to uber below. I did. you guys have done nothing so far. I get emails very sporadically and it still hasn't been sorted"
They are cheating us by giving offers and all are fake. One of the fake offer given to me free 3 delivery but when I tried to order. I found no delivery for that location.
Can't enter my correct data
Excellent
It's good
Ii
Excellent
"Keeps telling me my card needs to be verified, even after i just used it a few days before. Go to have a look no way to verify card???? Noe unable to order at all"
So i bought a new phone number but unfortunately it was used before in uber app Now i cannot register and when i tap i forgot my password it asks for the email attached to the phone number
"Good service, but some time not showing some hotel"
Worst app it doesn't login me
"I've been charged for food that I never recieved, had my food stolen from countless drivers, and had orders just get mysteriously cancelled with no explanation. All of those, combined with poor customer service, are why I stopped using UberEATS, until Eats Pass. I figured I'd give that a try, but oh boy, another Uber treat! Suddenly all my favorite restaurants were no longer available! Apparently, any restaurant on UberEATS means any of the ones they want to let you see at that time. Uninstall."
"Worst app, doesn't even allow me to login with existing Uber account. Uber drive account doesn't allow me to order food...what a pathetic app..."
We live 5 minutes from McDonalds and they deliver 20 minutes out the road but not in the city centre.... Ridiculous.
Love this app!
"Selection of available restaurants in Canberra was great, we've recently moved to Newcastle and I'm finding that the selection on the weekends is a little poor. Would love to see a better selection in the future."
I miss u uber eats
Best online delivery service I've used and l have used a few. Be sticking with this one from now on.
"Unfortunately this isn't a cache issue. Recent update removed all the filter & sort options from the search tab. Can't filter by delivery fee price or sort according to delivery time. Also, you can now only get the $0 delivery fee on the piggyback order if your order meets a $20 minimum. Delivery fees seem to have gone up in general too.. looking into other delivery services."
Great
Please come back in India the other app is not that much good as you
Very convenient and delivery charges reasonable
Great 😉
Fantastic Love Uber nothink better then sitting at home just waiting on my feed
Zomato is very bad ...we are expecting Original Uber Eats rather than partnership with Zomato
There's very little options ever to make a special request or options to write notes to restaurants. Should be more easier to leave notes on every item u order. Thank you
This app is the worst ever. From the 6 times that I have tried to order food on here. I have only received my food once and even then I was suppose to get my delivery free on the first order but didn't.
Lovely
User friendly
Good
"Had an order sitting at restaurant driver canceled. It sat there until restaurant closed at midnight and my hungry 5 year old went to bed not feeling well. Uber support team response, sorry about that you're not being charged for order and thanks for being gold member. I'll be removing my information from all of uber and using any other services instead. What a joke"
Want Uber eats back
everytime it shows couldn't complete order. plz update billing setting. though I selected payment as cash.
Charging me a second time 4 days after the order... even though I didn't order anything today makes me feel like theres security problems. When looking for a contact to get a hold of customer service to figure out what went wrong is damn near impossible. Can't get in touch with someone. I will be resolving my issue. Removing my payment method followed by deleting my account and never using this app again. I never rate app. First time. If I could give this app negative stars I would.
Omg Best Thing Ever..I love Uber Eats!!!
"Never have I ever had a right order from UberEats. The order is never right and this past order, they tried to scam me out of 15 bucks because of their customer service's inability to deal with issues. Never, ever use them. Just use Postmates."
It would be better if more restaurants to select.
"Junk app, doesn't set the current location and shows restaurant near previous location in a different state, and they still charged me for the order. I was not able to cancel, even with in 2 min after realizing that the restaurant is 1500 miles away..."
If you look at my account history you'll see that I used to order from Uber quite frequently and I have not placed an order since August of last. I got the run-around using the app trying to contact customer service on an issue. I had to make multiple inquiry to customer service and received conflicting information. I was told refund was issued and it would take 5 -7 days. I called back after 7 days and was told they are not going to issue a refund. They did not respond to my email.
Unprofessional
nice
Its useful.. But I'd much rather walk there. I find myself paying almost double what I pay for the product.
Don't waste your money here
"This app sucks. Something is always wrong with my order, food is always missing. The delivery people don't show up and my orders get canceled for no reason."
SRI LANKA
"NOTHING WORKS!!! Asks for my number then says, ""Something went wrong. Try again."" So I try again, SAME THING. Opening up the app that's the only option it gives me, nothing to help me login, or sign up. Wth is wrong with this app. Poor design? How does anyone get into the damn thing? I just want to order food. Now I remember I I never used it. Such a hassle. Doordash it is. Uber app sucks. Worst thing I've had to deal with since dial up internet. Don't waste your time."
Ubereat will block you after complaining for wrong orders.
I like it
The restaurants are great. The app sucks.
"Useless app kept asking for my uber linked number, mail account, doesn't accept when i give . Says its not the attached mail account. Uninstalling. Worthless app . Re: yes i already have an account with uber, which im locked out of , because i cannot remember the password and the bypass does not work, as a result had to stop using uber altogether. And no, i will not keep writing notes to you at various places. What I'll do is ,use alternatives that donot fail me. Thank you very much."
Good
Wish you could change the address for your location once you order. So many times I forget to change the address to my work or my home
"It's nice when you're hungry but it's to cold to leave the house. Only complaint I have is how much more expensive it makes the orders. Even for places just down the road, it adds like at least 10 dollars."
"I order and I cancelled right away, because I'm make a mistake but they told me if you cancel you will lose all ur money u paid!! Very unfair if I cancel the second I ordered! Don't use the app"
Great
"Im really enjoying uber eats. Im loving the new functions of the pick up, and being able to change location for delivery."
I never thought I'd use this but its dope as hell
Good service
"No Customer assistance number I could find anywhere after app bugged out and ""sent"" a driver to my address without ordering any food. Only service numbers were for drivers and riders. Would not recommend at all."
Excelent
Terrible app.
Great
Mostly get on time but still more colder than others
Driver pick up the food and never delivered it. Should be fired Restaurant took care of me and so did uber eats customer service.
garbage
Seriously can't even use damn gps . Delivery guy Wass like two counties south. What the hell happened ?
Cheated my money never refunded it and simple Closed my issues tickets without my confirmation
"Super convenient, but be prepared to pay more than your actual meal."
Its been hard to get the app to take a payment
Didn't get my $30 gift
It's not working download just Zomato
"Que raiva, se desse para deletar essa experiência, após esperar a comida no endereço errado e ficar com fome. Tá louco!"
"The delivery fees are ridiculous for starters. The only thing about uber eats that's good is the convenience of having your food delivered. I made a mistake in my order, attempted to correct it and was charged $90 for chicken because I couldn't get in touch with the restaurant, over the phone. And when I tried to cancel through the app before the food was even picked up, the cancellation charge was $72. I cant wait to see how uber deals with this issue. Update to follow"
Awesome
I like food.
ممتاز
Good service
Consistently an overall lower total bill than GrubHub and other apps. Uber Eats charges higher price per food item but has significantly lower fees overall . App works great.
Okay so I placed an order and it got cancelled then they said my money would be ruined which didn't as well the uber driver was rude and unprofessional she was in a rush or things but it wasn't necessary to talk in that manner or give an attitude to the customer if they're going to choose to do this job then they must respect and contribute with it. I will be suggesting many more not to get this app it lacks so many things including help servers it's not very helpful and I'm not happy one bit!
"Poor app, can't edit/change profile."
Excellent
Pretty expensive but worth it if your sick or cant cook yourself
Awesome
"The app picks the most inefficient routes possible, which results in food being delivered cold."
Great for work travel!!
"Great app, just wish we had the option to adjust ratings. We rated a restaurant 3 stars because they were missing a bag of food and we couldn't get a hold of anyone. The owner called a couple of hrs later. They had phone issues and personally bought the missing bag and a few extras and an apology and I couldn't adjust the review to 5 stars."
Love Uber eats
"Fire app. But the driver's get lost half the time. But that's probably just my location. If you don't get something you ordered they refund you that day, quality service"
I enjoy this app.
Love Uber eats! Great fast service. The food is always still hot when I get it.
Only used this app a couple times but it works so far. Love it.
I've had a few issues with drivers finding my location but other than that it's been quite fine
My distaste for uber support still exists but the app works nice at least and there are usually no major hiccups with ordering.
Always convenient and it's a bonus when you get free deliveries
Didn't deliver to the right place and charged me $30 anyway :)
Good and efficient
Over priced
Doesnt deliver where I live.
"Useful, fast and easy to use!"
Orders can not be cancelled right after you completed the order.
always on time
Excellent service
"Customer Service sucks, the app sucks, especially the promotion service. The promo says one thing and then when you try using the promo, it shows that it is over. And when you try to talk to a customer service representative, the answers are like automatic responses, giving you the feeling that you are actually talking to a robot instead of a person."
"Propaganda enganosa: As promoções nunca funcionam, sempre ficam como sold out."
Food is always wrong. Drivers dont check the orders
Pretty good
"The app is great, but I couldn't cancel my order and ended up force shut down to the app itself. Now it's frozen where it's saying looking for a person for it. I can't fix it, no matter how I tried to, nothing has worked. Please uber, I need help to fix it. I love using the app and I hope to be able to use it in the future. But for now I guess I can't 😭"
Always good
Doesnt work in my area
Address is inaccurate!!! Can't have location updated to correct spot.
I enjoy it. The only thing is when you order something and you leave stuff in the request coloum they never read it.
Fast and reliable!!
Does what it says
Easy to use and helpful
Get the f*** back here now with my s*** you were supposed to wait for me to come out of the pool at get back here now I'm coming to your sister's house personally myself now!
Works well. Delivery charge a bit high on some things.
"Usually does ok with food delivery, but the customer service is absolutely abysmal. Got a problem with your order? Forget about it - you'll be told to leave a review. Food cold and inedible? Too bad, you won't get that back and will still have to pay for food you couldn't eat as they spout ""Sorry, leave a review. It's not policy"" on rinse and repeat. Utter bloody shambles - literally the worst customer service I've had to deal with in recent memory. Go use Deliveroo or Just Eat instead."
"Besides 2-3 delivery personel who have NO sense of direction, 95% of my deliveries from Order to Arrival have been EXCELLENT!!! Love the app. I can crave a delicious meal from my favorite restaurant or a quick fast food option and it will arrive nicely packaged and ready to eat. Also, the delivery people are not trying to have a conversation with you. They show up, hand it to you, and BAM! DELICIOUS FOOD!!! :-)"
So far a great experience with the drivers and the delivery time. Had asked to help with fixing the issue with location and so far it's been resolved.
Great free delivery options
Amazing app!!
Suberb service deffinatley be using again
"Got my order completely wrong. The restaurant said they would replace it, if uber sent a new driver. Uber told me I had to rebuy the whole 55$ order and then they would send the driver and refund me within 5-7 business days. So a 12"" pizza with 3 toppings and a side of lasagna now came out to 113$... LOL. Don't use this service."
Very wow!
Payment always invalid 😖😖😡
Awesome!
Works every time and it's easy to use. Good app all around
"Was working well at first but now it gives me an invalid payment method message, tried removing and adding my card, still same thing."
👍
I ordered from McDonald's and it worked then the month later I tryed to order again and it said that the restaurant i chose i too far whrn its the only one I use
Better than skip
Great app.
Why you're updating your app when it is transferred to Zomato
I put 25 dollars on here and can't use it
Very Nice Experience
On time as promised. Never had items missing etc. Convenient
Awesomeness
Payment problem 😖😖😖😡
"No tienen atención al cliente. Cuando tienes un problema no te aceptan e-mails. Después te reenvían a una página que no existe. Pero eso sí, te siguen enviando correos de ofertas que no puedes canjear. Una vergüenza."
Payment any cash or card is invalid
i am located in a south island city in New Zealand and i have no access to the restaurants or any menus prior to the 10am delivery start time. i can only select my delivery address to which Uber Eats informs me nothing is open please come back later. this seems like lazy programming by a tech giant disappointing but otherwise a solid app HTC ONE M9 Feb/2020
I order a meal for the first time with a bill of £53 and never received it and it takes 48 to 72 hours to go back into account disgraceful service....
Maraviscreuso!!!
I used to love Uber Eats but you guys had to do it.. You sold to zomato..
We miss you so much please comeback. The other sites are so damn expensive and no offers.
Cancelled last minute
"Extremely repulsively irritating experience. Recieved someone else's order and when contacting customer service didnt recieve any replies. Not on the app , not on the Twitter account and not even on the site. No one is replying at all. Wouldn't reccomend this app to anyone. You're better off using the apps you're used to."
Have placed many orders and am told there isn't any drivers to pick it up. Add something that lets us know if there is drivers available to pick up food before we order!!!
cool
Use any other app. Never use this. They don't respond to any customer service issues. The delivery people don't even bother to check if your order is correct. They rape you here just like they rape you on a ride.
I hate uber eats. The worst support ever.
There is no way to reach the delivery agent directly in case of a problem with an order
Wont down load
"Fast service, but some delivery fees are crazy high"
Poor selection
"Terrible. You mean to tell me that if I used to have this account 1 years ago and later changed my phone number, why is there no option to get access to update my phone number??? Answer please!!! I just downloaded the app again, and it asked me for my phone number which I don't have no more. So then I tapped on the forgot password and put my email in. Now all of a sudden, y'all don't know me no more but been giving me services with my same information. I'm confused. I'm going to Door Dash"
I always thought highly of this service until today. I ordered almost everyday. I'll take my business elsewhere.
Bad
"Terrible experience order accepted and messaged driver addrress, waited 30 minutes after expected delivery time then got order cancelled!!"
Non arriva il codice di conferma!! Approfittate di uno SCONTO DI 10€ sul primo ordine utilizzate il codice eats-ipq9z diffidate da chi propone sconti superiori a 10€ semplicemente non sono mai esistiti! Ottima app e ottimo servizio!!
Excellent app and service. Thanks.
Excellent A++
Great
Good app
Very poor service from ubereats
I love uber eats. it feels very sad that zomato has taken this beautiful company.zomato is fraud I love uber eats
Pls include a Cancel option. Otherwise it's so annoying.
Why The F You Remove Your Company From India #Bringubereatsback
I wish there was an option to order for someone so the app can pick up the stores around their location and charge the delivery fee accordingly
Absolutley freaking terrible. Constant issues issues the app and then when something does go wrong it's a mine field to try and get through to customer service. They make you sit on the app and message them before you call just to have them ignore countless messages so they can keep your money when they mess it up. I have sc of them ignoring me for over 30 minutes while my order never arrived. Writing this out of spite so still waiting on them. Get doordash.
"Never use this, its a con, absolutely awful ordering system, steals money as wont allow you to enter offers. Avoid like the plague."
Very late
"10 euro si sconto con il primo ordine!! ""eats-8x9k9z"""
"App was good till 2019 but now it's not working properly. Now in 2020 Whenever i tried to open the app it shows ""We had some trouble connecting but should have you eating shortly""... Please fix this issue!!!"
"Unable to order anything keeps saying update payment option, even though I've used it before."
Good
"Always late, expensive delivery fees, I do not recommend. I always get my food cold"
worst app to give address!!!!
Fake. The app wont register an account for me. A waste of mbs.
Uber Is Closed
I use this every week due to traveling... I have my favorites now... Always fresh hot and quick... I could not go without it. 👍
"Stay away don't use !!!! If your food arrives flat cold they won't do anything about it and definitely won't give you a refund , absolute joke of a company"
🏆
"In couple of occasions, my order came short... Uber eats way of treating my complaint was pathetic, and they refused to refund me the missing items claiming that the restaurant doesn't do such mistakes in the first time... And that I have history in such cases in the second time. This is actually stealing."
Kottu hut moratuwa foods verry dull
🤦🏾‍♀️🥴
Food was good. Piping hot. Only fault is on my friends uber it states that mcdonalds castlegate is closed and clearly its not as we have ordered from here today and recieved our food?
This was terrible my grandma got it delivered and the guy made her pay even after my mom already paid and my grandma didn't know how it worked and he still made her pay after my mom paid
Good delivery service
"Force tip, I like to tip someone when I think the service is tops. To UBER you cannot put tip in as part of the service. TIP is not a service, please remove the TIP and make it an option or as I have always have been doing is to tip the driver when they reach."
This is app is going to make me fat!
Excellent
The service of ubar eats is very poor. Already uninstalled it. My opinion In bangladesh it's services are so poor. Shohoz.. Foodpanda better than it.
Good
H&
class.
Amazing
Good and easy to order
My experience was excellent with them.. I double paid my order which was my fault and report it to uber eats they resolved my issue immediately and refunded my payment.. Very professional and helpful
مشكلة في التطبيق بعد ما نزلته...أدخلت رقم الجوال والمفروض يرسل لي رساله التفعيل ...ولم يتم إرسال أي رسالة حتي الان
Service very good so far.
Order from all the time
Great app..... needing more Delivery drivers for quicker Deliveries
It has been good
Vv Good app
Satisfying service
Excelente
"Great service ! ,fresh food!"
Forever and whenever I have always thought of there but I don't know how it happened it got acquired by zomato and Uber application has failed it has stopped working
Bad
Good
"Happy with the service I've received so far, the app is easy to use and has a great variety of stores to pick from."
"UberEats has twice delivered the wrong meal, but they give no refund or resolution whatsoever. At best, one of these times they refunded $1 on a $25 order, which is just a slap in the face when we couldn't even eat the order we received. **UPDATE: I'm told they have refunded the full amount for the more recent order. Will update rating if confirmed."
Great service all round
"Uber Eats makes it so easy. I'm pulling a double shift so, I need a lunch delivery."
"The apps services where much better in the past. Whenever the restaurant would mess up your order they would refund you. Now there is no honestly to their system, they always tell you sorry, and do nothing about it. There is a standard that your food should arrive in, and when that's not kept, the restaurant should pay and Uber should assist with the process. But clearly Uber eats protect the restaurant at all costs even if it means that I was not provided with the items ordered. Worst Support."
Very helpful when out of time
Great platform
Fast and reliable services
"It's been great so far, been using this app for a few years now. The only thing I don't like is they charge you extra if your food is less than a certain price..."
Good
Good
كل م اعمل اوردر يظهرلي طريقه الدفع فيها مشكله و انا مش عارف اعمل شكوي.... كل مره علي كده
The deliveries are always on point👌
Unprofessional shhhhhhhhhhhhh
Miss u Uber eats
Decent experience
للاسف الطلبات مخالفه للاوردر وخدمه العملاء سيئه جدا وداعا ايها المهملين
"Its amazing, I love it. Best food delivery app."
Why have you sold yourself to zomato??? I was in love with your application. But now I just hate you.
Fast
Eh
My order was cancelled after waiting an hour for it and no explanation was given. Would not recommend
Worst
No services my area ⚠⚠👽👽👽👽
Great!!!
The service provided by uber was so awesome but now since zomato accquired uber am not able to do any order and zomato is not accessible in my place... Hope I would get a solution for this..
Awesome
"If you dont have a driver dont let your consumer pay and wait , only to be cancelled on . I'm just hungry guys, it's been 90 minutes . I will still continue to use this app, because overall its the best food courier service. Only compliant i have ."
Didn't receive order
Good
very good service
The App is great the freelance delivery service is poor too many guys take too long to collect and then deliver..it's ok late arvo or early evenings but cold or very late 50 percent of the time in the later evenings
Excellent!
U should give more discount
very good
Good
Excellent and on point😊😊😊
"Looks pretty good, but sometimes fails on Android Go (device Redmi Go) during ordering: I guess, RAM ends or something like this"
"Can you answer on here why an amount is taken from my bank and another for the same amount is pending? It happens all the time tying up money in my account. You replied to me previously saying contact you but it's not that simple. I've managed to email once, then you reply to me but I can't reply to you, I need to send another new email and it's ridiculous going through the motions to get to that point. Why is it only your app and no other food delivery apps that have this problem????"
Arfin
Recently Zomato has owned Uber Eats...so I don't know why this app even exist...lol
Help I need to stop
Very worst app. I have downloaded it first time and it is asking me to give password. Don't download it.
Excellent an very easy to use 👌
Can't cancel late orders. Please fix this. Edit: the problem is some orders are super late AFTER the restaurant accepts it. So need a way to cancel late orders even AFTER the restaurant accepts.
If I could give no stars I would. Pay money for food for it not to turn up and then have no way to get in touch with the driver and no number to get in touch with the company. Absolutely disgusting £23 down and still hungry. Shocking!!!
A restaurant is well within range of me yet apparently it does not deliver here.
I love you
Zero customer service I was expecting from uber higher level of delivery but I was disappointed. Most of the time some items from my order was missing
Drivers Behaviouris very good
Best
This is the worst app ever and the worst customer service. My food was delivered in 2 instances to a different addresse and my money was never refund because they said it happened the first time as well ! Well is not my fault if you guys cant ride and addresse properly. Dont use this service
Nothing in my area.
"The app is great, i just hope you can add a feature that makes it possible to order from more than one place at a time if the shops are near each other."
Very poor verification method first you have to enter mobile number and password reset comes to email
Very unsatisfactory service. I placed 2 orders. The first had missing items. The second had damaged items. Uber refused to refund me. You're response below is not helpful. There is no way to contact you regarding my issue using the link below. I have already contacted customer service. Have a look at my account.
Great
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Really easy to navigate. Saves the day
Best 😍😍😍
Great especially on sick leave
Customer service agents not helpful(My account is not working since 1month I tried contacting Uber eats support but no-one helped.It show's an error and asks me to confirm my cell through a text but I never get that text
I am not be able to open the app. It's showing that Uber eats will open as Zomato. What's the matter ? Plz help. I want to order through ur app.
Horrendous experience. After being delayed an hour my order was canceled without any contact. I called the restaurant and they said I could pick it up (before the driver was assigned) but when I got there they had no idea about my order. And then I saw I driver assigned and went back to work. The tracking map showed the aimless wandering and then my order was cancelled. Could not contact the driver or a real person at Uber Eats at any time. Unter No Eats is new name.
Sometimes it says unavailable but it's good
知らない人を内に来るのは怖いです。料金も高くなるし、距離も考えると自分が取りに行った方が安心です。
Website I heard not so user friendly.
Very good service
Pretty good app for food delivery
Very effective and efficient way to order meals my 2nd time but the experience was awsome
"Not good, many mistakes, longer time, nobody is responsible when there is a mistake, takes to long to fix an issue with the order"
I'm lazy so it's nice but because a cut goes to uber eats its usually overpriced
I have ordered fish meals where as they have delivered chicken. Waste of my money and time. Dont they know the deferance of checken vs fish????
So I buy 29.99 of food. They charge me. But then they put a $29.99 hold on my account. Can take up to 10 days to get it back. So I've paid $59.98 Why the hold. They reply to make sure it's me.
Gd
Suddenly unusable. Can't enter an address. Please help UberEats
Dumped this app
"Great App, Quick , Easy And Very Accommodating."
"Blows. Spent $60 and got the wrong order, and not even half the amount of food I paid for."
Awsome
Most of time it works well just occasionally it just doesn't work
Fast and intact delivery.
"No options to log into a previous account. Absolute waste of time, don't change your phone as you won't be able to get back on the app"
"They one time send me wrong food, which I order. And second time they didn't have delivery guy which I have to wait for almost one hour !"
"Their employees are questionable at best and after getting my food after an hour and a half it was wet and cold, their customer support told me it was fine and that I was overreacting, I'm pulling a full Karen here and telling you that if you want good food delivered professionally go with Skip The Dishes, or just walk, don't trust these yahoos. I'm 26 by the way, not a boomer, never complain, but this was ridiculous."
"This app sucks ass. I order food and 3 drivers later gets food to me ice cold and an hour after the ""latest"" delivery time. I can't cancel my order via the app when no drivers are available."
"I'm unable to use the app, there is an account confirmation error that doesn't seem to clear. I've tried confirming through my email but still can't place order"
Nice
i loved it
Awesome
Very fast and courteous
Loved it
More orders cancelled than delivered. Hard to get refunded.
Bring the app back i dont like zomato
Pays drivers worse than other platforms apparently
Good service
😄Good most of the time.
I find it difficult to query anything with Uber on the app
"After using it three times for two different restaurants I am very impressed with ease of use and the wide variety of options, especially late nights when I really want to be able to get something to eat but not enough to drive anywhere myself. They charge for the delivery fees AND the service fees for the Uber as if I had taken the ride to go pick it up but saved me the hassle of doing just that! Always handoff at the car, they never get out and walk up. GREAT APP!!!"
No way to contact support. Twice our food has not been delivered
An app that brings convenience and customer service to your door
"Horrible horrible horrible! Delayed my order for almost an hour. Then, canceled it. I am starving. I could've gotten my own food and eaten it by now. Will not use again. Please don't use, not reliable."
Not able to login
Always have a great experience
Whenever I am opeinig the app it's automatically it is redirectiong to zomato so your going to continue that means I will unistall this app.
Bahhboom
Terrible app.. i just tried this service for the first time and i am disappointed in the difficulties in placing a simple order. I got charged the wrong amount and i couldn't even start a chat or send an email. I had to google customer service who put me on hold 3 times only to tell me a supervisor will call me back in fifteen minutes. Which was 2 hours ago. Other services are much better and convenient. Ubereats disappoints unfortunately. Pay attention to your card charges for unauthorized fees
need more fast food spots like ralleys and canes
"Not bad, alright delivery charge rates"
Couldnt find a driver even after 1 hour.
"Unable to find restaurants that are available to others in the same household, looking to order at the same time. Yet if another address closer to the restaurant is put in, it's now found the restaurant. Is there a distance bias going on between different phone brands or operating systems?"
The worst app to order food from they cant help you if you put the wrong address they still take yoir money too
Awesome but bad at the same time lols spend to much money
"The app itself is okay function wise. But recently Ubereats added service fee which is ridiculous because when I contact customer service, they aren't helpful so I'm being charge a ridiculous amount and I would also need to tip the driver. So expect to throw $10-15 on just fees alone. Everything on the menu are also double the price."
Great services
"As someone who has little time for cooking or grocery shopping, I would be in a pickle without this app."
"Not happy looking to see about food and, phone fell on bed and order and try to cancel and it charged me"
Loved it
"Terrible support, everytime something goes wrong with the order"
Good
"Always works, convenient easy 2use"
Convenient. Pricey on occasion but it's a cost of convenience. Generally good experiences across the board and has gotten me out of meal jams.
"No sé si es culpa de Uber Eats o de los restaurantes pero curiosamente todas las veces que he pedido por Uber Eats en varios restaurantes, en TODOS siempre me hace falta algo, siempre me quedan debiendo algún producto de lo que pedí"
Good
"Wish there was a way to cancel your order after a certain amount of time, so annoying waiting two hours then it cant be canceled until someone just decides to?"
"TRASH!!! Don't ever change your location or the app has a hard time figuring out where tf you are despite having gps coordinates to where you are. They are never on time. Always missing items. Never polite. They are late, rude, never accurate, they never show up on time and when they do show up late they give you cold inaccurate orders. Worthless. Go to doordash or literally just walk.they are trash. Trash service, trash orders, trash deliver, trash time. Trash experience in totality 100%Garbage"
The driver took $30 cash knowing that the food was paid by the app I need my money refunded.
Faster delivery than some of the competition in my opinion
🔥
Always quick On time
"Used to be a very good app, but now everything just goes wrong. Had a problem with two of my last orderings while two of my friends had problems recently (one order for five people was delivered just for two in one of the instances). Also everything costs more now and there are very few promotions (most of those few are promotions to get the price you would pay without the app)."
Great service
"Efficient, easy to use and service is on par! Good job y'all!"
Excellent
"I uninstalled the app after receiving an order that smelled like an ashtray. I got a non-committal response from uber customer service. They failed to acknowledge that it was a problem that their partner smoked in close proximity to my dinner. Offered a credit, but what I really wanted was to know that it was accepted as an issue and what steps would be taken to ensure it would not happen again."
"The app is counter intuitive in letting you select your delivery address, including reverting to a previous address if it has ANY kind of glitch, their customer support is a sham that doesn't listen, has difficulty understanding what you say unless you are using super simplified phrases, and they dont do anything if there is an issue and its on the app's end and not your own."
Orders often get cancelled and i have to wait up to a week for a refund. By then i forget
Good
They raise the price on all item from any restaurant by 1.00 or more
Great service just forgot my hot sauce
I think what makes uber eats so great is all the Moorsish (black) people who brings me my food. They are very respectful and kind hearted when you come. I mean i respect and love all people. But there is just something about my people that makes me feel good when they bring me my food. Happy Negro month.
"Uber Eats cares more about your order, and resolving complaints and concerns than the other delivery services"
Expensive but reliable
Twice now food is never delivered. No sort of customer service. Basically order at your own risk. Might get fed. Might not.
Really waste of time service think ill stick to just eat. orderd food driver had problems up at my end god knws wat no call no messages jst cancelled my order i had kids waitin up for there food n it was a school day never again vry un professional service.
😘😘
Driver never picked up my order
Uber erro pops up. This app is cancer
Good and swift
Kewl
fast easy and intuitive application.
Crappy service. Order was cancelled by driver because he was lost. Never again will I order from this app.
"Comes in handy, very easy to maneuver."
They need a contact button when the orders are delayed by over an hour - ridiculous there's no way to cancel the order after multiple delays
Very buggy latley. Forces to close and start over way too often.
Can't disable advertisement notifications. Will not reinstall until they provide ability to disable them.
Only use once
Like it
Excellent
Mostly good experiences. Only some have been bad.
This app doesn't have cart delete and uber cash options
Orders are taking longer to be delivered
"The price is same as in store and sometimes you get free delivery on some restaurants,witch is verry convenient"
Life saver
We don't want uber eats to be joined with zomato uber eats restaurents are more reliable than zomato and interface is more flexible than zomato
Makes getting food at work a breeze
Ordered food through uber. Food was cold not edible. Contacted Uber for help but they were rubbish wasted my money
Tengo ofertas y descuentos cada dia. Mencanta
Uber team consistently refuses valid documents.
Delivery driver wouldn't come to the door and brought friend along for the delivery. Customer support didnt do anything. Told me to rate driver. I'm deleting the app. How is that for a rating. Garbage waste of money.
"Update- feb 10, 2020: I am done with Uber eats. Waited over an hour for my lunch. The driver never showed up to pick up my food. The app said the driver was arriving and the restaurant was wrapping up my order for over an hour. Called the restuarant they confirmed the driver never showed up. Couldn't have lunch. Uber eats offers me $5 credit towards my next order lol. I quit!! #wishtherewaszerostars"
Some places you order from menus be lacking items that you could get if you were in the restaurant.
So awesome!
Do its job
You charge a delivery fee and a service fee! Not fair!!!
waited for 2 hours only for my order to be cancelled.
Good promotional offers. Great to know when your food will arrive. Only downfall it Crashes sometimes during busy periods.
I like the fact that the app gives you the option of tipping upfront or after Services have been rendered. I tip afterwards based upon the service I received from the driver.
"I can't order, I don't understand few days ago I could order but now I can't even order a meal"
Trash I ordered and 40 min later they tell me my order has been canceled because they couldnt find my address and now I gotta wait for 77 dollars to go back on my card
"In my experience, the only way to reach a human working at the Uber company, is to write a bad review. And a bad review is rightly given. I have provided the requested confidential payment and identity card details, in turn you still have not authorised my payment card in your system despite I have purchased Uber products one million times using this card and use it all the time on your competitors services (while waiting for you to respond to my request)."
Great app really convenient and easy to use
Won't load
"Terrible, will never use again. Almost non-existent and confrontational customer service. Avoid!"
Hopeless app...kept on inserting my address bt that is as far as I could go...it wudnt take me any further than that...waste of data...
Nic
Really bad experience in London - can't even get a simple delivery refund for half missing food items in one delivery. Will not be using again after using this for a couple years. Edit: I did contact your support team and they couldn't help. Edit2: Adding an automated response will not help and your support team still couldn't help.
"Couldn't get to a screen that allowed me to actually see restaurants. All I got was a screen to enter my location, and select when I wanted to deliver. Useless. Worse than useless. Edit to add: Found out that Uber Eats is not in Park City, which is where I was. The error message I got was ""unable to determine your location"" in the location screen. That doesn't exactly tell me that Uber Eats is not available in my location."
It's just a really cool modern service. Love it!
Best way to attain type 2 diabetes. Great way to get food but it makes fast food too easy to attain. If this company goes out of business it will save lives. 5 stars because it delivers food as advertised.
"Poor services, delaying orders and cancelling them last minute."
Doesnt care about customers
"Won't let me pay :/ A pretty essential feature, i think"
"I used to really like this app but unfortunately, they charged me twice on an order (""a hold"") and when I tried to get issue resolved, there was NO resolution. My bank statement still reflects the charge even tho they deny the charge."
Blah
Great service
💪👌
Great app & great service
"The major thing I hate about this app is that it will automatically try to add a tip to the cost. If I want to tip, I'll tip after I have received the service. Stop trying to make me pay a tip before I see the service that I would be tipping."
On the 26th of January a Uber Eats pass was purchased to the value of R50 from my debit card. When querying this Uber advised its a known issue and they'll try to resolve it ASAP. On the 31st of January a R107 was taken from my bank account for an alleged trip whereby there's no trace of. I called Uber support and they asked me to send my bank statements which I did. Till today I have not received any of my money back. I removed my banking details from the app to prevent further charges
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!Charged twice, agreed refund, still waiting 3 weeks later. Have an email saying that they had processed it and it was my bank taking the time their end. Spoke to my bank, they told me that uber have lied and are stalling so they don't have to pay. This is beyond a joke. NO CONTACT NUMBER. NO REPLY EMAIL. STILL NO REFUND. MY BILL ON MY APP SAYS £0. BUT NOT GONE IN MY BANK. WHATEVER YIU DO. DO NOT USE UBER EATS!"
Nice n easy app... some areas r better then others
Food was well packed. Quick delivery.
Can't create an account. No password
"I've used this app many a time and it's worked fine but recently I've had an extremely frustrating error message appear when placing an order. The app tells the me the location of the restaurant is too far but these are restaurants which are shown to me based on my address so I should be within the catchment area. Furthermore, I have placed orders multiple times at these restaurants and had no trouble so why all of a sudden am I getting the same message for each of them? Fix it."
Why they became ZOMATO in india..zomato is worst..I'll go with swiggy now..uber eats was great in discounts
Easy to use. Bonus if you are ordering something someone else is ordering for free delivery
"Horrendous, i recently ordered from UBEREATS and the IDIOT driver got lost so I had to leave my flat to COLLECT my food! I want a FULL refund and Ubereats way of responding to this is by ignoring my email of complaint about their INCOMPETENT delivery driver! I will NEVER order from them again!"
Got food to my tummy
I can't sign back in to my uber eats app after I uninstalled it.
App is unusuable for me it just tells me welcome back even though ive never had this app i cant even make an account to order food
If uber eats is shut down in india then why you are providing updates.
Why did you merged with zomato. It was worst with bad interface. We need Uber eats back
Why I keep receiving promotional text messages when I unsubscribed??? How can I STOP THIS???
Seems like I keep getting charged for stuff I haven't bought or the payments are taken days after the transaction. Can't trust this app.
One of the best food delivery services I've experienced this far.
Excellent
Bad service and uber eats refuse to sort the issue
Fast delivery
Good
We need uber back...zomato is a freak
Its too good love this app😘😘
Great
"Love incomplete orders. Maybe the restaurant forgot to send it, or possible the driver kept it. Who knows."
Excellent.
So far the app had done good for me
The only food delivery app i loved♥️ Miss you uber eats.
Fast delivery
Love the app but wasnt happy when I canceled an order. And still was charged. My fault. Wont make the same mistake twice.
"Fast delivery, food hot and fresh. Nice polite delivery man"
"The app itself is really nice to use, I just think the drivers could do with better training on how to handle the food sometimes."
Fast and reliable
Simpul
Good service
"It was really super app, Fast delivery, Many offers and promotions, There are lots of food shops And it accept card or cash in option, its easy and useful app"
My experience with Uber eats is very bad... happened many times...But I review 5 Star for support ZOMATO.
Good
Best app ever
Good
"Tudo certo se está tudo certo, mas se der algo errado o suporte não funciona..."
Makes using Amex Plat Rewards difficult on purpose
Awesome. Had food delivered in multiple countries right to our hotel. Perfect when vacationing with kids.
Would recomend to a friend
Plz read it for once for your own benefit. I suggest not to download it. Because when you order food you need to pay tax and delivery fee. And any discount is hardly found and u can rarely use it . Other apps is better than it because we can find not only found discount but also can enjoy a delivery free food. That's why I would like to suggest to not to use this app. Other apps is much better than it.
Good service.. thank you for solving my earlier problem..
This is a valuable app 👍
I am being shown 'Your account doesn't have a password' and i am unable to register. What to do @uber?
great PG
"The delivery man apologized for how badly the food was packed by the restaurant. The paper bag was leaking with liquid that was quite hot. Otherwise, delicious and on time 😃"
Excellent service
I can't order food.there is no option.it is totally useless.again i can't log in with my account
very good
"Enjoy ordering food from the app, very convenient."
To many delayed orders with no way to cancel.
Up charge is RIDICULOUS. I was charged for things I did not order and they REFUSED to refund my purchase. I strongly suggest the use of GRUBHUB
"Awful. Order cancelled 3 times, refused a refund and told to pay a 'cancellation' fee"
"waited half an hour over the original delivery time rung support, they cancelled the order and i had to go buy my own food and now the bank is holding $38 for 5 to 10 buisness days, called support again they told me i have to go and sort it out with my bank, now im $38 short for possibly over a week and uber eats offered me nothing in return and told me i have to go sort it with the bank because of a major stuff up on there end, im very dissapointed, this is not the first time ive had problems."
There is no sign in option for new user When i put my phone number and click the next button it says you don't have any password with this number Disgusting
"One year ago I used this app in my computer. Then i didn't use it. Now I install this app in my phone but when i enter my number it shows ""you have opted out and message START TO this * number"" but i can not sent message to this number but i have enough message balance in my phone. What is the solution?"
Is uber eats collabrate with Zomato? When i m ordering it's showing that plz install Zomato But i am comfortable with uber only
Very good
Good
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
paying top prices for cold foods. never arrives on tome.
Whenever i open uber eats it is suggesting me to order from zomato and the app says that i have been using app since july 2019 so i should switch to zomato but i prefer ubereats what should i do help with this
This app isn't working
"You can't change the delivery adress if you put a wrong one. That's the most useless food app I've ever used. More than that, they don't even have a live chat section in order to discuss with them to manually change the delivery adress. P. S. The driver isn't allowed to deliver to the new adress if you want to change it afterwards. Thats uber eats policy"
Expect to jump through hoops to get your money back...and not even all of it.
I love uber eats its just exceptional and fast... My only recommendation is that they should allow us to order from multiple restaurants at once.... Otherwise it's perfect they're very fast and my food always comes hot
Great app
Ok
Lost all the charm of online orders by selling to zomato. :(
Great app
Supported
Very bad customer service
I hate their customer service
Horrific customer service
Unsatisfactory customer service
Poor service
"Constantly getting cold food after waiting for more than 2 hours. This used to be a great deal, but now it's not worth the headache. After waiting for 3 hours for food again realized we have no way of contacting anyone to cancel or get update. Really inconvenient when you are trying to get lunch at work. At this rate I will be on my way home before the food even arrives"
Best food delivery apps.
Uber blocked my bank card so I can no longer order from them... n8ce work
I didnt receive half of my order. The driver and car wasnt the one in the picture and to top it off they seemed like they weren't sober. The food I did have was freezing and I got another ladies soda choice. because they did multiple orders and sent the driver to a location way on the other side of town first when I was a four min drive away. I reached out no reply. Great variety but good luck actually getting service or refund if your order is screwed up or missing items.
Excellent
التطبيق لا يقبل الدخول اليه الا بحساب باوبر توصيل
"Got changed for an Order that never arrived. With no direct way to contact Uber I gave the driver a bad rating and complained. Uber sent a No Reply text to me claiming the driver contacted me and I didn't answer which was false,I instructed the driver via app's text system and the driver lied and the company kept my money."
Why you left us? Please come back.
My entire order was wrong and I had to go back to the store to get my order. They refunded some ridiculous amount that didn't even cover what was left out. Once I brought my kids their food from the store my food was cold so I threw it in the trash. I would rather give zero stars for terrible service and worse customer service.
Overpriced and almost always late
No cancle option
There is no more Uber Eats in India. So this is pointless. Thanks for abandoning us.
"Absolute waste of time, keeps saying that nowhere near me delivers when I know mc Donald's does"
Tried to type in my address but when I press save it comes up with an error loading message. Uninstalling.
Can't log in it keeps asking me to set it up but it's already set up then says your email is already registered with no option to log in. There is no log in option that is my issue
Super convenient but the app says I'm too far from one place but online it says I'm in range
Awesome experience
رائع
Excellent customer support and online services
Great app super handy !!!
"So like I ordered my food, they charged me, and no one delivered it. They never returned my money. So besides not returning my money, I also owe the bank for something I never event ate (bank told me it was because of uber eats) I was charged $84.00. Wouldnt recommend this app."
I think it is goooood
I did have an account but i do not remember the details. It does not give you the option to create a new one further creating problems and frustrations.
Why this app is still here? Zomato acquired ubereats
Good
Great
Good
My uber eats has stopped working since December... the sight isn't clear enough on how to fix it..
very bad srvice 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
I love it
This review is for zomato not for uber as uber eats now become zomato.... You can't give any feedback about the food you got from zomato...because they ll block you..as suspicious user. I loved the uber eats but as it becomes zomato ..my uber eats account also get blocked.. So don't tell them if u didn't like the food🙂
Great
Awesome App
The service is very much helpful in your busy life.
I am very much sàd that uber eats is merged with Zomato and even uber eats app is redirecting to Zomato app. Uber eats was good but zomato was 😵
Nice app.. delivery is on time.. rider also good
Nicee
Not many options in my area yet but my first experience with my order was great.
Works great
Stop asking me to rate the app
Epic
Easy to use and reliable.
nice...
"Ever since prices got bumped in 2020, I can't order anything without basically getting my meal bumped up +10 an I really can't justify $20 on one meal at McDonald's or something it's just not worthwhile anymore"
"Interface is stupid , Delivery zones are too small. Far inferior to competing apps But great prices. Update :NEVERMIND YOU GUYS HAVE SOLD YOUR APP TO ZOMATO"
good
"The driver cancelled my trip without coming to my location on Uber and it charged me Rs. 50. When I claimed that it was the driver who refused to come, it showed that the amount was credited. Bt now it doesn't allow me to order anything from Uber without a credit card"
"second time I've opened the app because of an offer, fill out an order over $15 for the offer and the offer doesn't really exist. Put up with a lot still liking the app but I finally uninstalled because of this since it's just straight up misleading. Hate this..."
why uodating when the app is no more available in india
Too many faults/ errors
Love it i'd love a discount for my next order also ;)
"Map is always wrong, otherwise the app is great"
Driver can cancel if they are too lazy to deliver the order. FU^# uber eats. Back to grubhub.
Solid 10/10 fufill your inner glutton
Good
great
"Tipping at the completion based on the performance of the delivery, would be cordial. Also,the first screen is quite jarring.A wide variety of assortments, choices, pictures, and words all at once. Making it quite difficult to navigate, almost overwehlming.Visually the similarities of the free delivery choices vs recently ordered, vs the rest(in color,font,structure,layout,text boxes)makes them quite confusing.You almost become lost in the wide variety of choices without differentiating."
Good
They delivered wrong food.
"Excellence service with this app, excite when my order revived, convenience and time savers... enjoy this app!!! 4 star ☆☆☆☆😂👍"
Wonderful !
Fastest way to order food 🤤
So far so good!
Horrible service and extremely unhelpful customer service. You are better off using other delivery services like doordash or postmates
"Cancelled my order after an hour of waiting, still no food, and now I can't even order because they 'are catching up on their orders' WHERE THE HELL IS MY FOOD?!"
Uber Eats came on my phone automatically and I didn't use it at first but one day I did and it has been a life saver a time or two for me. The people who have delivered the food have always been courteous and handled everything with care.
"I put my location on because it told me to, and it sent it to my last address in a different state. I called the driver to cancel it, and I can't get a refund because they already made it. Why put the location and make me check my address just for it to be sent to my last previous address. What a waste of food and money. I have read other reviews, and this has happened to a lot of other people. I will never be using them again!!"
Muito desorganizado
Old phone was destroyed and couldnt log back in with my account. Until that gets fixed i wont be using this app
It did not get my whole order.
"Uber eats hands down best food delivery. The app rules, restaurants are on point, drivers prompt!"
"La peor experiencia usando una aplicacion de entregas. De todas las veces que pedi todas llega la comida fria, la atención al cliente es pesima y el gps no actualiza bien."
Great and fast service
Became too expensive
very convenient and good customer service.
"Después de 1 hora pueden cancelar tu pedido sin ningún tipo de justificación, y encima la aplicación te sugiere que vuelvas a ordenar. Cómo volver a ordenar si no sé por qué se canceló? Debería ser obligatorio para las casas de comida y los repartidores comunicar la razón de la cancelación."
Handy
"Driver stole my food again!!!!! I am an uber driver, I have never stolen food! I placed an order, and again the driver messaged me to say she was here, and again said my food was delivered, and never showed up to my door! Conveniently, the system was down so the driver couldnt be contacted! I'm aware I'm only one customer but damn! My business matters too! I'm sure people will overlook this review but I will NOT use this service again, no benefit of the doubt anymore!! Shame on them! Zero ⭐s!!"
I was charged for food not delivered. When I tried to get help they said help not available at this time. They automatically deducted tip. And the site they said to go to for help was bogus. I've used urber eats for years but it's not working anymore.
"Sempre atrasam pedido! Pratos disponíveis não condizem com o que tem de verdade, muito abaixo dos concorrentes"
used to use it for lunch all the time but the new fee set up is not single order friendly. If you're buying for multiple people all the time you might like it but no longer worth it for one person Edit: now anything under $15 gets hit with a small order fee. Really can't justify a single order anymore
Llegan promociones y al agregarlas dice que no puedes agregarlas. Además siempre llegan mal las órdenes.
No option are displayed and everything shows as unavailable. I search and I get 0 results And I know there's restaurant near me that has uber
Great job!!
Great app great service
"I made a complaint about an hour ago , i made an order at rally's and Tara cancelled the order before she even picked the food up to take it to my house. She should not be able to make delivery's again since she did not let me kno why she cancelled the order."
"Pedido demorou mais de 30min, vi o motorista se desviando e quando liguei, ele simplesmente desligou o telefone. Logo depois, meu pedido foi cancelado. Ainda, não tem um canal de reclamação para deixar registrada a falta de compromisso desse motorista. Infelizmente, vou desinstalar esse app e deixo essa recomendação para quem está considerando utilizar: não utilizem! Motoristas podem fazer você perder o pedido e não tem como deixar reclamação da pessoa especificamente."
Convenient
"My number one issue with this app is the lack of notification about when an order gets canceled. So many times when I'm working and I schedule a delivery for when my break is, I'll be left waiting, go look at what's up, and see it's been canceled. No email, no push notification, nothing. I can't order again because my break is when it is, so I'm left with no food. Fix this. I should get a notification telling me what's up, not just the order disappearing off my app with no explication."
"Pedidos são cancelados 2 horas depois de serem feitos, sendo que a entrega foi adiada 3 vezes sem motivo nenhum. Ridículo"
Great
Small order fee!😡🤬
Great easy to use app
"not working, since the last update."
"When it is raining sometimes the app acts as if it's not functioning, too many people using it perhaps or something. Apart from that it's works great."
"They make you pay for the delivery, not talking about the 8.99 regular delivery. I'm saying they make you pay for that, plus like 20% ""fee"" and then ask for a tip. Which is basically forcing me a 20% tip, like id gladly give them 20% but never by force."
"Very nice app. Reasonable prices on deliveries, and there are always great deals available."
User Friendly
Bugs that order food and unexpected charges on immediate cancelation
Ótimo!
App has many problems.
Great
It's a bit expensive but pretty convenient for when I'm to busy to go out or cook something myself.
Poor very poor
Best thing ever!
Takes a bit but yea its good
Good
ALWAYS GOOD ONLY ONCE WAS IT LATE WHICH I SHOULDVE BEEN OFFERED SOMETHING BETWEEN RIDES AND FOOD...
Terrible service
So far so good. Used 3 times
"The app doesn't have all the menu items for multiple restaurants, very inconsistent as I've order this item before and now it is gone but definitely is still an existing menu item and there is no way to report this issue on the app so imma give it 1 star cuz its not even good for what its designed for"
Easy to use! I love it!💖
"Shite, let's me order 1 day and not the next!!!"
90% of the time your orders correct but when it's not good luck it takes forever to get it sorted
"Bad service. Constant price hikes make it an unreasonable choice. With all of their fees, an $11.55 order for one gets bumped up to $19.34. If you live alone and only order for yourself you're better off using something else."
Cant search my address at all.
Not availabel in cyprus.i lost time to login end give my personal data end after i was told is not availabel in my country.shame...
Uber Eats is a fantastic application and drivers come on time rate 10/10 will continue to use it in the future.
Happy for uber service
"""Could not complete order, verify payment"" my debit card still have the sufficient money for the transaction, I've been trying many times deleting the payment method and putting it again, and still don't work. I'm uninstalling the app."
👍
I love the app
ONE OF THE WORST FOOD DELIVERY ACCEPTS THE ORDER AND AFTER 2 HOURS CANCELS IT WITH ANY UPDATE AND THERE NO OPTION TO CONTACT ANY PERSON !!!!!!!!
Just ok
Not what it used to be. Fees on top of fees on top of fees. Slow delivery times. Having to tip BEFORE the order is even delivered to you. Unresponsive customer service. This does not justify me having to save 10 mins of my life to go down the street and get the food for myself.
Absolute garbage. How can you expect to make any money with an app that you cant sign up with? Stop wasting my time.
I don't have the same options as my siblings despite having the same delivery address and I can't even find some of the restaurants they have on theirs
Good quality
If uber eats is acquired by Zomato Then why the f***k you ask me intall
"Terrible customer service & unreliable delivery - 4th time in a row that my order was messed up or not delivered - drivers cancel orders instead of contacting you through app - Uber Support useless cause all they say is ""sorry"" but do nothing to correct it....deleting app for Door Dash....update 2/8 he ordered from Uber Eats and now HIS order was cancelled after an hour of waiting....this is s constant issue with using your app.."
Won't download gets to 80% then crashes
Works great
I was on holiday to the canary islands an nothing works it pisses me off even though there are restaurants that have Uber Eats Calle Pizzarro 8 is where I was.
It is dum
Fine
Ok
Excellent
"UberEats was great until the most recent changes in pricing. In the new version of the app, tips are included and cannot be edited. You might as well call it a delivery fee. Taxes and fees are not covered by promotions. Why? It's also glitchy and doesn't remember my payment info. Furthermore, I cannot even place an order, so it's useless. Back to Doordash."
Its ace just stay home food will come to you it's good how you can see where the car is on map
Hate this app. There's no cancellation option or method of changing the address even one second after the order has been made. I have lost a lot of money. I recommend using any app but this one.
"Poor customer support, they dont have live chat or a number to call for order issues, this ultimately leads to significant wait times for any sort of issue resolution."
I placed one order and it made 3 orders. There was an issue with the app. I did not accept the food of the 2 additional orders and they refused to refund me. Shocking customer service.
Great prices!
Love it
"No funciona, multiples errores siempre que he intentado usarla."
Cant reset account or unbind phone number. Also cant reset password
Very easy to use and large selection of restaurants. A great option when you cant leave work.
Grand
"Took my money but did not receive my order. Phone calls and so called live chat have not resolved the problem. I have been given uber credit to spend as a ""refund"", but both the app and accessing my account via a web browser will not accept the uber credit as being a valid payment . Very unhelpful. The first and the last time I'll be using uber. The experience today amounts to a form of theft."
"Muito bom, a comida chegou certa. Recomendo"
It's not allowing me to order out food... I've been trying this for a few hours now and still I have no success.
"Waste of time, gave it a second and third chance, absolutely terrible. Is there less than one star?"
Not in Alberton or Germiston area yet. What gives???
"F*king sucks, I couldn't even make an account because someone already used this phone number before I had it and there's nothing I can do about it, can't find costumer support to help me out either. Too simple."
App sucks. Downloaded it put in my phone number set my number has been used before. Wanted to email that I didn't know which one to use and couldn't get past the first screen
Drivers and delivery's are great
Greatttt
"It used to be worth it, this app now has an outrageous %10 ""services fee"" I hope everyone whos greed and money/power lust drives them at uber CORP gets shot in the face and dies , but not before they desperately beg for their life offering large sums of worthless currency G R E E D Y S C U M skip the dishes doesn't charge a ""we're greedy jews fee"" i recommend skip the dishes"
Love when I get free deliverys.
Very well... Love it... Thank you uber.
I don't know what updates they have done but I can't even access my Uber eats app.
Excellent!
Nice app
Fabulous
It is a lifesaver for when I am under the weather
I have had incorrect orders three times in a row now and it has not been the restaurant's fault. The drivers arrive late so the food is cold and are careless with which order is which.
Love pizza
Quick and easy
"Ok uber please comeback I hate using zomato,it feels like a bad dream"
"Just eats app is more user friendly, can see delivery charge without adding food to basket average delivery charge £1 - £2 And one click to see food hygiene rating. Uber eats you can't see food hygiene rating, average delivery is £3.50 - £4, you won't know the delivery charge until you add something to your basket. Uber eats is only worth it if you use one of their promotional offers which they send out desperately via email"
App not working my phone
Very good
App doesn't update location automatically. I placed an order to the wrong location by mistake. Cancelled the order within seconds. Called uber eats to confirm the cancellation. They confirmed cancellation and promised to refund money within 7 days. Needless to say no refund 7 days later and they claim no refund possible now. Never using uber eats. Support is a sham.
"First time ordered, first time trouble as part of my food were left behind and uber eat poor communication. I never get contacted back. Will not recommend."
Uber Awesome
"I can't sign in. Every time I try, it says this number is already associated with an account."
Nice
"Terrible app. The place didn't have something in stock so it asked me to cancel order or edit my order. I tried to edit my order but ""something went wrong"" and the order was subsequently cancelled whilst the place had started to prepar the food. Won't use again."
"Note that if your order takes over an hour (fault being with restaurant), UberEats will not cancel the order unless if you want to be charged for it. After my second try with a different agent, having had waited almost two hours for my order was the order cancelled with no charge. There needs to be a better policy for this, very unacceptable!"
Same meal is cheaper ordered from the main competitor's app...
Missing You UberEats😭
Search doesn't work. Doesn't accept any of my credit cards.
Use another food ordering app The first time I ordered through Uber eats it took the man 50 mins to arrive from 3 roads over and he brought everything wrong The second time I tried every single time I put in an order it told me it was unavailable for delivery The third time it also let us go through our whole order with multiple restaurants only to not work and say not available Never had any issue with any other food delivery app but this one has had its 3 strikes and it's out
"Uber driver was rude on the phone, he wouldnt bring my food up as I live in a high rise and i couldnt go down as i had a baby asleep. Still didnt deliver my food. Never had any problem until now."
Is there uber eats has became zomato
Too many choices.
The worst customer experience. Abysmal customer service. Avoid uber eats and this app at all costs.
Super fast and easy way to order food to be delivered. Saves me time and stress!
Loving it
Dificil ubicar la direccion de entrega
"App horrível, funções básicas não funcionam corretamente, não tem como se comunicar com o motorista, vocês lavam as mãos pra tudo como se nada fosse problema de vocês, devolvam meu dinheiro e a minha coca cola 600"
It's efficient
All things considered nothing to complain about although there are a little things they could do better such as adding new restaurants such as debonair's
They have dramatically increased prices. Not only is their a service fee and delivery fee that usually amounts to at least 7 or 8 dollars but all of the prices are roughly 30% higher than in the restaurant. Something that would cost you 10$ to pick up could be closer to 25
",😎😎"
Awesome
Excellent
sucks
Great
Very good for when I don't feel like leaving the house
Pretty good
Super
Best delivery app ever. Grubhub is so ghetto
Why you guys closed down..... Zomato is worst
Más de la mitad de los lugares que aparecen no me deja pedir diciendo que el lugar queda muy lejos. Los lugares que si aparecen tienen todas loa elementos pero solo la mitad tienen el botón de 'Agregar al pedido' habilitado. Solo dejandon pedir items regulares y ningún combo / promoción. Y la página web es peor. Intentando ingresar un código de descuento te envía a la página de uber regular y los línks de ayuda no tienen lugar donde reportar una incidencia
"My experience was not pleasant at all, for more than ones the restaurants are not updating their menus and hence got disappointment that they can't deliver what o order, what is worst than that is telling me that I need to accept other options which I didn't pick!"
Runs in background and gives annoying promotional notifications.
Could not use because someone else had an account when they had this phone number and it wouldn't let me create an account kept saying welcome back and enter your email you used to register. I am a new customer but cannot log in or create an account. Oh well. I'll try another delivery app.
"No se hacen responsables ni el restaurante ni Uber cuando un pedido llega incompleto, su atención en call center es pésima."
Great
I just got stuck waiting for an hour for an order to get cancelled because they couldn't find a delivery driver there was no option for me to cancel and no number to call to have them cancel the order. I'm very upset about the lack of control or ability to contact some one once the order was placed.
app not working properly on android...
I try to log in but it keeps telling me my email is already registered as if I'm trying to set up a new account. So I can't even use this app!
Order food from McDonald's with strict instructions Regards pickles. My food arrives covered in pickles. Make complaint to these dodgy firm. And they do nothing about it apart from a generic reply.. No wonder the TFL doesn't want you here.. Be very careful dealing with this rogue company
Vorst app Useless app
Good
"It is nice when you can not leave someplace and you can call a restaurant and have good food delivered quick and efficiently. There is a wide variety of choices and the delivery is quick, efficient and friendly."
"Awesome convenience and great deals, what else could a person want😏😜😎"
I have been using ubber eats for a while and it's been the best I've always paid cash on all my orders but all of a sudden I can't order because I have an outstanding balance that I do not know of and I can't find any customer service to help me
Fast and easy way to order the food.....I love it 👍
excellent
I had a driver make me wait almost 2hours for my for then on top of that when he got to my location dropped all my food on the floor in front of my building and left with no explanation. So disrespectful me and my kids starved that night had to make sandwiches for them. I got money back but I have never used this service again since then.
Can't sort restaurants by distance or even see a map of the restaurants like other delivery apps.
keeps telling me i have opted out of uber messages
They steal food and get lost too often.
Order a few times but needs to have a contact number
I like food
Fast foot somewhat high prices but affordable.
Great
Awesome app Excellent
Me and my husband are greatful for this service. We have had great service each time we've used it.
No order cancellation even for the first 10-30 seconds after placing the order. Tried to call the customer service to cancel and they cannot even extend the help after asking personal details (Whats that for?)
Saves going out
Love it.
"Was best , but since it merged in zomato , it just became trash as zomato. 👎👎👎👎👎👎"
Good App
K😶
Good
Not satisfied
Value for money. Good offer and discount. Easy reach and plenty of restaurant options.
There is absolutely 0 quality control with this app.
"The app guides through a uselessly long, phone number AND email-based sign-up process, before finally letting the user know after wasting a good deal of their time that the service is not yet available in the area."
"Not even worth it, food never showed up."
Infuriating and just awful. Half the time it let's me order from McDonald's and then at the check out says I'm too far away. I'm not to far away because I've successfully ordered loads of times. I've wasted so much time on this useless junk app that they probably paid hundreds of grand for.
"Can't do the registration. I don't know what happens everytime I give my phone number, it says this number does not have any password. What the hell. please fix it and give the solution."
Good
Good all in all The timing sometimes is not right.
It has a uber way of adverting
Good happy
Sometimes the orders are not right. Other than that it's good.
Really bad experience with uber eats. Driver is always in a rush few times brought me half of my order. Really really poor service
I appreciate it so much being that im slightly incapacitated.
Why have you removed the app😔
"Its not working, every time I enter my mobile no it will give me a message that my account dosen't have pass word!!"
"Rating 3 so they may see this. I had one good experience. The others were fine or iffy. I've had missed items and delayed times that were luckily refunded. Last order I placed it said a 30 minute wait, which is fine. It ended up taking over an hour to find a driver to pick up and she will have to drive another 25+ here after I pulled it up on maps... I feel bad for her at this point and I'm freaking hungry... Get your algorithm together so I can go local and save on extra tips, usu preferred."
"Terrible service, sold illegal meats and uber eats only said I did jot specify what I wanted??....... mind blown!"
It's the best
It's the best delivery ever
Very good app
the apps ask for number...after inserting my number it gives an error no password is added and there is no option for entering password
90 % of the scooter drivers come in cars and cause alot of confusion and problems in recieving the order.
Excellent
Excellent
Very few restaurants signed up in my area
I just uninstalled this app the service is just awful
Good
Good app when food is a problem to buy in the middle of heavy work!
É a 5a vez seguida que a uber eats Portugal entrega meu pedido errado ou com os itens faltando. Não consigo contactar a central...enfim
Smooth app. An essential for me as a student
Very very complicate log in progress make it easier. Otherives guys u loss your customers.
Nice
"terrible, requested sauce again and none. Will delete and nether use again as non English drivers get wrong orders and app does not send requests. waste of money as my whole family now hate the app. Will also stop using the taxi service due to safety issues. After pressure from children I decided to chance it as I had a stock of sauce from collecting my own orders. This time had three random sauces added but should be an option at checkout and the automated emails for complaints, be helpful..."
The worst possible service. Use deliveroo.
Super site
Good
"Hasn't applied my promo offer, very upsetting"
"Broken to all hell. I can't seem to choose any where to order from, yet it's telling me that Uber eats will notify me when my delivery is here, yet I've not ordered anything at all, what so ever. I can't get off the screen to select where to order from."
Very effective
Exceptional
Worst app ever... Can't make a new account
World's best food delivery co.
Don't use very bad service. I recieved missing items in my order and response on my report and solving delayed 2 days. Also removing live chat make the communication too difficult.
"I got someone's else's order, the help form I filled out then crashed and wouldn't let me get a refund and then the same store I ordered from was then ""too far away"""
Y u have collided with zomato
"Not accurate at all, people take your food, using door dash from now on"
"As a partner and customer: The scripted/automated helpline is akin telecom service - useless. I've also had my address listed as ""too far away"" because 1 driver couldn't find their way. Never thought I'd say this - going back to menulog!"
Great.
"Took almost an hour and a half ""preparing"" the food before telling me t he order had been cancelled. Thanks a lot."
The app simply doesn't work. I mean that literally as after signing up I can't do anything apart from look at a map of my location. I can't even close the app without restarting my phone. Guess I'll be sticking with Just Eat then.
No way I will spend money for this garbage.
"40 mins late then when it arrived on the app noone shows up , thanks for wasting my time"
The best local food app
Why you guys are with zomata now? It was so easy to buy from uber eats and now it's zomato. I hate this
"Terrible app, tried to place an order, it then went back to the homepage when I was trying to pay."
I Miss you Ubereats in India (Banglore)
Exlant
Honestly what's the point if the app just doesn't work. Seriously sort it out pal.
Nicely
Not so bad Thou at times it gets orders wrong we can't be refunded and very slow services but after all we all have hiccups there and there nobody is perfect
Good
Pretty good. Edit: I originally rated this app as a four but after I rated it the pop up asking for rating keeps popping up. You fixed the issue but now it's down again since I used the regular Uber?
It won't let you know that the restaurant is too far until you place your order!!! Don't even show me the restaurant if it's too far so I won't waste time ordering imaginary food!!
Restaurants should enhance the Taste of the food.
Super
Mc.donalds
Best discounts are available here
"Download the app but it doesnt allow me to log in. Ask to put in my number, which i did. But then say acc no password."
Good app
Usually very good worst part is some delivery people are on bikes so food can be a bit to cold when delivered
Thrid class app
"Absolutely awful app. I was charged twice for an order and they will not refund me. The driver's are mainly lovely but is app is constantly screwing up, I'm now £15 out of pocket. Please avoid! Edit: I have already spoken with Uber about this issue, they refused to refund me and kept closing the case everytime I asked why."
Sucks No number to call.
"Always on-time, always exactly what is ordered. Perfect when you need food in a pinch, or when you just wanna have a lazy day and stay home. I don't have a car, so this also has the added benefit of giving me access to restaurants farther away from me. 5 stars!"
Good
Excellent
"It does not take bidvest card, it keeps kn deducting and reversing money from my account without allowing it to be used for a purchase keeps on requiring verification but cant veify i tried till i gave up on it."
Very good application
very good & please advice your representatives to take into consideration the notes we apply when we order the meal
What does it help installing the app if you not in the area?
Love it
"Awesome app, fast and we can get best offers"
"Cant put my exact address into the app so using this is horrible, every time i have done the driver has had trouble finding my place."
worst ever
Just used it twice now and perfect both times
Haven't had any issues since I started using the app. #happycustomer
Nice and simple app for ordering good beverages.😊😊.
"Do not waste your time shady company, takes your money less than 1 second takes a week to refund with someone from India calling you. Company does not support American jobs but loves that American money. Rude customer service it's a free market try another competitor. Better yet just order dominos directly"
Expensive and honestly not worth it unless it is your only option. Total BS app. Greedy as Hell.
Guys had the medium hot box sensational However where is the meat 2 slices pork 2 beef 4 chicken and some piddly bits come on do the right thing put it up a buck put the meat in if you cant time to get out of dodge we are you life support The public look after us stevo
I used to use this app for odering and i was soo happy...but one day when i try to oder it shows that they dont deliver to this place...dont know why this sudden change happens
😍
Thank u uber eats ! Will miss u !!
Terrible service! Food always wrong and missing items. Impossible to contact people to get issues sorted.
Best
The app itself is great but good luck if your order gets messed up. I reported it on the app and messaged UberEats on Facebook. It's been 45 mins and I've gotten no response.
False advertisment
good
Why the hell is uber eats acquired by zomato? It's really a very bad interface and bad choice
Sup
"So most things are way over priced to begin with 2 dollar sandwichs are 6 dollars ? I don't think so .Then a blatant slap in the face comes when the ask for you to add a tip for what service may I ask .If you choose not too tip automatically your charged 2.99 . Here's the kicker. There's a delivery fee a service fee then tax. These charges add $10 to your order. If you order small orders these fees are higher. They make it to either way if you buy anything, you're paying $10 for using this app."
Truly a great and must have app
"Poor customer service. I have made several orders with them and they get it wrong every time so far and even items are missing. The drivers are rude, the staff think you are trying to make money of them when you ask for a refund . I feel uber should stick to taxis, they are very poor at this business."
I use this app every so often but it hides restaurants as default and only show what they recommends (show things by distance as default) and no i dont want to tip drivers this is Australia we are ment to pay a real wage to our workers this is not america.
Drivers are terrible in van
Takes too long. Taking an hour and a half to pickup McDonald's is unacceptable.
"Good, not great."
Switching the delivery address is not user-friendly
"I can't open an account, it says ""your account doesn't have a password"" when I submit my phone number. I have tried with other phone number but still the same."
It's easy to use and great after a long day at work.
R u crazy? U have collaborated with zomato... Do we have to keep both the apps for ur own benefit. Uninstalling both the apps. U deserve it man.
عملت اوردر بالخطأ لان التطبيق اصلا يحفظ رقم البطاقة تلقائيا ويخصم المبلغ تلقائيا من دون ما يطلب منك تأكيد الطلب ؟؟؟ انا لغيت الطلب في نفس اللحظة والتطبيق ظهر عليه انه تم الغاء الطلب ولكن خصم المبلغ ولم يتم ارجاعه لماذا ؟؟؟
Straight up robbery. If you don't answer their phone call they straight up cancel your order no food or refund. What kind of delivery driver sits in their car waiting for you answer their phone. Couldn't leave my food at the door could? And they purposefully made the app so you can't contact the uber driver after the cancel. This company is a leech in every respect. Would not recommend.
Ok sometimes others not
Disgusting service! I'm going back to Mr Delivery! They may not be great but they have never stolen my money and refused to help me! Horrible service here!
Always getting my food cold and have had issues with the uber crew spending off down the road of my house not very happy i tried to get a refund but they dont want to lose money
"Ever since uber ears launched, I've been trying to make an account. A whole year has gone by and it still says that there's a problem, please try again later. This is frustrating."
Unable to sign up app assumed my number already had an account and wouldn't let me sign in or log up due to previous owner 🥵Delegating ! Going to GrubHub!
Useful
Good
I had frozen food delivered and contacted ubereats about it literally within 5 minutes after speaking w/ the store manager. They said they would look into it and get back at me. A week goes by and I get no update. I email them just to be told they cant do anything about it or credit me back. $40.33 on 3 meals for 2 co workers and myself wasted for frozen food to be delivered at an office and be thrown away. DONT USE THEM!! GO TO DOORDASH!!
"I cant access my uber eats because my email is set up but not my phone number!!!!!!! Ridiculous! How the hell am I supposed to log in!? Dumb. *Update response* - I can't! I can log in, but I cant confirm anything because it's sending a ""confirmation text"" to the phone number on file, but there is no number on file. Guess what, and it wont let me add it!"
Easy to use and accurate tracking. Good variaty and they deliver until late. Update :as of 2020 its absolutely shhhhh!!!! Something had definitely changed and it's for the worst. The app Is only available when it wants to and only for certain orders! It was decent enough before but now it simply shait and unacceptable!!! Wake-up uber what are you thinking!?!? If the plan is to piss off existing customers then mission accomplished!!! Just deleted the app as no longer worth it! Good riddance!!!
"Most of the time is good service. However I have had issues. A few weeks ago I tried to order dominos through uber eats to an apartment I was staying at, the ETA display malfunctioned and stayed on processing order, significant amount of time went by, I then was unable to cancel the order. The eta went to delivered over an hour later and I was charged for pizza I never received! Raised a dispute for it and never heard anything back nor a refund/ credit."
Always good a winner
Misclicked on order and refunding would only give back like $6 of my $28 order even though I tried to refund immediately
"Uber eats needs a check and balance system. Since there is an upcharge on the food, a delivery and service charge, the orders should be on point. To have several items missing is totally unacceptable. I am rethinking using Uber eats. It's not worth the hassle"
"Very slow, can't contact head officers, need help"
"I work in a steel mill in Portland Oregon way out in the middle of nowhere. Its a 12 hour shift 6pm to 6am and its scary down there. One night a young lady brought me a sandwich but the zombie ninjas, trolls, and mutant coyotes tried to rush us. Luckily she had her sword and between that, a hardhat and screwdriver we beat them back to the swamp. Later we split the sandwich and tended to each others wounds from the fierce combat. Ive never met a driver like that since, and I think of her often..."
Very very nice app or fast delivered
You should be able to sort by distance for pickups. A huge feature that is much needed.
Excellent
Entrega + taxa de serviço e o preço final fica uns 15 conto a mais
Great
"Just tried my first order on Uber eats. I paid $23 for 3 meals at McDonald's - filet o fish, big Mac, and 2-cheesburger, with fries and white milks. Instead, they brought 3 chocolate milks and 3 fries, and zero sandwiches. I tried to contact Uber and there was no phone number, and no chat. I tried to call McD's and Uber didn't have a phone number for them. My wife has used Door Dash 4 or 5 times a week for years with no issues. Irritated having wasted $20. Back to Door Dash."
Horrible . The app canceled my order because it was unresponsive and I got charged for my order that I didnt get 25.00 for nothing but a head ache save yourself time and dont bother .
"Don't bother. Uber policy is blame someone else, help is non existent and the meals aren't deliverable."
"Horrible experience, when there's a problem with something at the store or the driver, there no way to cancel it without it charging me 16 dollars before the place cancelled the charge 2 hours after they were closed. 2 hour stand offs to not get charged was gruesome"
Awsome
I advise everyone to not use this app. These guys don't care about customers at all. My order was cancelled by the delivery driver for no reason. I found out through a Google search that it's a quick scam by the drivers to get free food. I better get my refund back! Most pathetic app. How does tech company still exist if they can't fix this loophole.
"This was the first time I used this service. After waiting for 1.5 hours, my order was cancelled. I'm never using Uber Eats again and will advise anyone I know not to as well."
Best delivery I have had
App is legit and easy to use. Never had an issue.
It's great
Driver was efficient
AMAZING! さいこう！　
"One of YOUR drivers stole my order! You all didn't help me with anything. Big whoop, a refund on an order not received. But no extra effort to fix something your hired driver did? I see why you have an F rating on BBB and don't allow reviews on Google. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS! What are you ""supporting"" anyway? Company profits at the expense of your customers? Thanks Uber!"
Hope that your order isn't incorrect because support won't be willing to help you at all. Good thing Toronto has plenty of other delivery app options.
The rider was patient and helpful. 👍
$8 meal becomes $20 from 4 fees
Ordered food. Kept delaying my deliver time. I ordered at 840 and by 10 10 still had no drivers. Had to get my son into bed so I had no choice but to cancle order. They had the nerve to actualy charge me. It's not my fault they had no drivers? Door dash is the way to go! Atleast if I have an issue I can actualy email them! No option to even email this company and wen I tried it said that it dont reach a support team. I 100% do not recommend useing uber eats.
Service and fees are ridiculous. Only reason I ever use it is when I'm somewhere Seamless Seamless isn't available.
Ok app but the cancellation without any explanation after a long wait is pretty intolerable.
"Worst experience ever, they cancelled and charged me for my order"
Always positive. No complaints Fast effefficant service.
"Literally wont let me order anything. I've tried multiple cards at multiple restaurants, now I'm ordering through post mates and they are working just fine. Uber eats just completely sucked to be quite honest."
Its 50/50
"The first time was not successful with order at subway on Howard. I tried to order a future pick up and i was complete the order around 1210 and this huber eats program then said the order would be be ready in 15 minutes for an order was for the future at 1. This caused problems and was frustrating. I had walked over to the Subway two differnt times in the cold, and even the second time I went there they did not have a slip for the order and just made completed my order because of my upset."
"Our order said it would be ready at 6:42 and when I arrived to pick up the food at 6:42 they told me it would be ""at least 30 minutes"" for the order."
awesome but needs fasta pasta
"Buggy, certain things don't show up on android. Continually get 'Verify payment method' when trying to check out for no apparent reason. I will be using other food delivery services from now on."
Delivery to a random address I have never been
Very good service
Love this app never had a problem
"2/8 reducing to 1 star, got someone else's order, and still have no one to talk to. I'm hungry and annoyed. Great app when ordering food, but impossible to get help from a human being when there are issues with the order (like it's 30 minutes delayed), where the customer service number?!?"
Awesome App
"I have used this app for a couple years to receive food delivery mostly without issue. I decided today I would become a delivery driver. In the app there is an option to become a delivery driver in account settings. I clicked the link, chose a city, read through the terms and conditions and selected continue. That's where the process ends. The app goes no further. I scrolled up and down, side to side to see if I missed a checkmark button. Nope. The continue button is dead. The sign up incomplete"
Exceptional
"My food was horrible,,and pack very poor,,,tops came off food was in the bottom of the bag,,,,tops came of butter an whatever else that was in the bag,,,what happen to the salad,,,my food was cold,,,with everything WRONG,,"
Very good app
The delivery times are a bit hit and miss but this has as much to do with restuarant as it does uber eats. Also drivers often make more than 1 delivery at a time
Nice.
"Meal delivery is supposed to be convenient to the consumer. That's why we pay all the fees. So it's pretty frustrating when the delivery driver picks up your food from down the block only to take it halfway across town to other deliveries he has waiting already. Then they drop off your soggy cold food, late and expecting a tip."
"Extremely convenient, have had only positive experiences using this application!"
Exceptional
Good job
Best app around !!
"Too many service charges, has to be a way to circumvent this with a multitude of first time deals like grub hub. This app has the best drivers and most reliable drivers by far. Gives you most creativity with quick flash options on free delivery making someone who doesnt know what to eat get quick inspiration and forces them to decide quickly ."
"I downloaded Uber Eats on my tablet because I lost my phone, unfortunately they need to send a message to my phone in order to continue so it didn't work."
There's no option to pick up the order rather than get ripped off with user fees
Super fácil pero deben ampliar un poco el radio para disfrutar de más opciones
Driver did not deliver my food the first time use this app.
"First experience using the app. Only half my order arrived, and never got the other half. Was offered a refund but still disappointing."
"Cant use, seems my email is already in use, no recovery options... Disapointed."
my gf was at work and sent a delivery to the apartment where I had to pick it up when arrived. instruction says ring buzzer or call my number. so he doesnt do any of the instruction and calls my gf while she's at work. so I missed out on the delivery... For someone who doesnt read instructions. come on uber eats.
Is very good!
"For a company that is relying on uber eats for profit, and you cant you even go back on a choice to the home screen without the app crashing!!! Absolutely ridiculous, mediocore an embarassing! Seriously guys!!!"
App stopped working and there is no support for it. No options on the website to assist.
"When picking certain food items , one is forced to add paid additional components, as the option for ""none"" is gone. In this case I want a burger from BK and it forces me to add the same forced complements 7 times, as the menu is duplicated 15 times. And the problem is not my phone, the problem is the lack of professionalism of whoever developed the app. Pathetic fail, to impede your customers to give you money, because of faulty menus. Cleaned caché and app data, doesn't work."
Giving amazing discounts. So worth it!
Took way too long for delivery
"The app it's self is easy to use and navigate. However the service is another story. Half the time my orders are wrong, which is primary the restraunts fault or an uber driver not paying any attention. Uber always gives me my money back but come on, communicate to your stores the necessity of confirming an order."
Great
Good and efficient service!
Id give five but you translated poutine as putin. It was funny but wrong.
"Trying to order breakfast but everything is unavailable. If uber stopped allowing pushbikes to deliver paying customers food there wouldn't be an issue of no-one wanting to work when it rains as they would all have cars, as they already should. I do not consent to any order being delivered by pushbike, we are not in Asia."
"Utilizei um desconto (cupom) que recebi via email (F*********0) da própria Uber Eats. O aplicativo disse que havia sido aplicado com sucesso. Mas na hora, o pedido descontou do meu cartão em seu valor total e sem os R$ 20,00 do cupom."
Great app
Im ver satisfied with the app
"Does the basics, but also missing obvious options, like 'don't show 30 restaurants that aren't even open', or being able to sort by distance. Also really inaccurate location finding."
It clitches
Great
"Quick, easy, done!"
Placed an order for delivery earlier in the day and received no notification that my order was cancelled on me
Good
Terrible. Deliveroo is much better 2 out of 3 orders the food was late and awful and Uber eats refused compensation.
Could not find a delivery person and they cancelled my order after waiting over an hour.
خدمه زباله الاكل بيجي ناقصى. حاجه زف
Always some bs u dont get all your food an on top of that u never get the money they say they gonna give u back I'm taking my ass back to door dash
Uber Eats worked great the first time I used it.I love it !😀
"There's issues, but works well overall"
Fast service and amazing drivers.
Prices are vastly higher than in store menu. No customization. No communication between customer and reastraunt.
Simply quick.
"Últimamente, los repartidores se hacen los perdidos y no contestan para que cancelen el pedido y quedarse con la comida. Está última vez me cansé y por eso ya no usaré la aplicación."
Let's you invite people all fine yet when they give you the $20 referral credit all of a sudden there is a problem placing my order! Wont sent the verification # to any phone numbers tried mine and my boyfriends ridiculous ! No way to contact the customer service sent 2 forms not 1 reply I want to order now not 3 days from when you feel like answering my request???
"I made an order to Dairy Queen that never arrived. I had to send three messages about it after it happened in the same day before they replied. They told me they would get back with me after they investigate the matter. They never got back with me. This was days ago and I sent them another message today when they replied to me they said they can't help me because it's been too long. They lied, they don't care about the customer."
uhu
50/50 on whether or not the driver knows what the heII they are doing
"Great app, any orders that go wrong are missing food items from McDonalds Ashfield or Stanmore doesnt matter, wont order from them again."
Very easy to use
"They told me to rate this or my family was next to be ""delivered"""
The places you order at sometimes dont even get the order put through to them. Had to call specifically to the restaurant to tell them they had an order to be sent out. Waited hours.
Excelente servicio.
"If you love having to wait an extreme amount of time and pay 15% more just to get cold soggy food to eat EVERY SINGLE TIME, then this app won't disappoint you. But if you want hot food and pay reasonable prices to eat, stay away from this service. Absolute worst"
"So far, so great!! Love the app! So convenient!!"
What a waste of time.. Camt update payment. I deleted. Worst app ever!!!!
"Drivers have been exceptionally well. Respectful, prompt, and courteous."
KFC ordered with 5 hours notice for delivery between 19:15 and 19:45. Order was cancelled by Uber at 19:45..... 🤬🤬🤬🤬
"Get me my noms, not always quick but hey not bad"
Fire
"Easy to use, quick and efficient"
"So far so good. On time and still hot, every time. 😊"
Acho um pouco complicado procurar os pratos e também tem muito bug so tentar fazer pedidos com mais opções.
Awesome
Terrible application consistently gives the driver bad directions. It tells them that they've arrived when they're blocks away! Switch to using Google Maps Api! Both myself and my wife have cleared the app cache. The driver is told their at the destination when it's a mile down the road in the opposite direction. They consistently call us asking for us to help them. It's not my app that's the problem it's your driving directions for the driver puts them in the wrong area or half a mile away!
Pooping
My order was wrong and what I received smelled like cigarette smoke.
Fast and polite
Easy to use
Convenient and efficient. Missed many of purchases due to incomplete orders.
Excellent
"Omg...I downloaded this app. Ok, I wanted to order some food and I admit I had doubts after seeing so many 1 star reviews. So it appears I'm already registered with it. But I cannot log in or anything..it always gices me the ""get started with ubber"" landing screen. GUYS, HOW DO I LOG IN?? Or do I have to use another email again just to order food? What a joke..who created this app I wonder..I really wish I could give 0 stars. No wonder it's uberFAILURE. STAY AWAY. Deliveroo is my next try.."
I tried to download uber eats and it couldn't acknowledge a German phone number. So apparently it doesn't exist
Great app can use anywhere
The best food app
Easy convenient and good service
Can't Cancel Orders
So far the service has been fantastic
Unable to log in or reach customer support. I got a new phone and when I try to sign in there is no where to enter my password. Then when I try to contact support it tells me it's an unmonitored email. Well why is it listed then as the support team? Update: I have gotten the same automated message 5 times even after asking to speak to someone higher up. Your support system is a joke and will never use Uber eats again. Terrible customer service and they don't care about actually fixing the issue
Awesome app.. now I go nowhere to eat..fat 🤣😂😭
"I cannot use app because I opted out a long time ago from SMS messages and now when I try to opt back in I CANNOT ....THE MESSAGE WONT SEND BECAUSE ITS LONG DISTANCE. There should be a better way to re register after someone has a change of heart....AFTER REPLY FROM UBER--- So I followed link and it was useless, I did not find answer and the personalized response requires me to have an account WHICH I CANT SETUP BECAUSE SOMEHOW UBER BLOCKED MY #, thanks for the fast altho worthless response."
Delivery was late
I will never use uber eat I cancel my food and they charge me for something I didn't receive or eat I'm using a different app now
"Constantly getting my orders wrong, if you order kfc they'll bring you sushi. Don't waste your time"
Just Perfect
"Pretty good app, usefull, but I can't change the address or know how to cancel the order and/or check what's the address of the orders and I have made the mistake of using an old order to make a new one without knowing it was to a different address and so I was left without a way to fix it. Overall the app is a little confusing, with elements missing and/or they are to confusing or well hidden."
Rubbish they never deliver to me in my town. Even though it says they do just goes on forever saying preparing your order then cancels it after an hour simply boring don't waste your time with this rubbish
Easy to use and fast
App doesn't allow you to remove credit cards information also has no customer support line to assist if the wrong card is used cancell button doesn't work
Very stupid application 😠 takes 3 hours to deliver
"Easy to use, invaluable!"
Love it
bekar
La aplicación envió el pedido a mi domicilio y tuve que volver por el pedido
Worst customer service
"Fast and reliable, has a wide range of restaurants"
So far so good
Buena app para comida rápida y restaurantes.
they keep sending me discounts via email that I am not eligible for
Okay now I'm getting spam notifications from Uber Eats. Would like to know which notifications I can turn off while still receiving important messages about my order. NO SPAM!!! No thanks Uber
App is very easy and simple to use.
It's great it just needs to let me know that a store is closed before or while I order so that I dont waste time looking for a meal while the restaurant is closed
The best
"Disgraceful service, cold food , items damaged and missing and when I complained I recieved abuse and threats, disgraceful service."
Great
"For the love of god, can your developers please allow us to pinpoint our location on the map! This makes the app very frustrating because I always have to call the courier and give them instructions. The original uber app allows you to pinpoint your exact location but the Uber Eats app does not. Please add this option and I will rate 5 stars. *****Update 2/8/2020**** The option of pinpointing is still not there. Bad support. Please download your own app and view it for yourself."
Everyone is friendly and also food comes quick.
You make a mistake and the delivery boy decides he can keep your food plus get paid for it.
Ótimo e gostoso
Uber eats band kyo ho Gaya I miss uber eats please relaunch
"Good app but the fact they give a driver 2 deliveries at the same time, so far away from each other aswell is ridiculous. Got an order 45 minutes late because of this. Ordered from elsewhere meanwhile and even that order came first!!!"
Driver ate my food
"The app has become semi- reliable and useful for a one stop shop for takeaway. I've found Customer Service to vary from person to person. The estimated wait time can be a little ambitious and the delivery charge just increased so its certainly not something you'd use every week. The higher Delivery charge has become a nusience as I had gotten used to the Lower one (which was already a bit much). If there was one spot that I'd improve, it would be lowering that."
Great for foods to eat
I don't know why but it really annoys me when it shows that the driver is on a bike when they are not. Every single time I ordered it would always be delivered by someone in a car.
Amesome app
it's boring only pending no action /movement
"Aucun de mes restos sont disponibles, jamais, jamais, l'application connais mon adresse mais ça me propose quand même des options qui livrent pas chez moi, et le temps que je passe pour faire une commande et que ça me rejette pour être trop loin du resto, les autres restaurants à disponibilité sont plus disponibles. Et à chaque fois cest comme ça. JAMAIS DISPONIBLES."
"Terrible I had fraud on my account steaming from December 2, 2019 I have A house in the country and I went out of town early for Christmas and where I was at there is no Uber Eats. There is no Uber you have to drive over town to the store. So I told Uber eats that and when I try to use my Uber Eats account recently, I still can't order now I have money on the account and still can't order."
May I know why this app is still here when its purchased by ZOMATO
Extremely easy to use
Won't let me add my card to get food
The whole experience was good however Uber eats sent me a deal off my first purchase and yet did not apply it to my bill in the end. It's was 500 off my very first bill:(. I wonder if in the reviews u can add a field to custom write rather Chan only choose options of being unprofessional etc. As the fellow who came to deliver didn't come with change for cash payment. And therefore he returned with a hefty tip which wasn't even planned :( In the end food was good and delivery was on time:)
Winderful!!!
I still keep getting offers from Uber only to be told every time we are not in your area. Why make the offer if I cannot use it.
"Top one for food orders, food delivery speed and rates when compared to other apps are very good"
"Great app, food was quick"
"Eats Pass is a scam. It is worded in a misleading way, implying that all delivery will be free. This implication is emphesized by the removal of delivery costs from the restaurant selection menu. All delivery is not free, however. This promotion is misleading by design. I am also no longer offered free delivery on nearby orders, a consequence which was not mentioned in the pass description. And the 15% off only applies to the taxes/fees, not the order cost. Very slimy. Lost a customer. Uninstal."
Excelente app y descuentos
"Flipping useless tells you it's not in your area when it's on the corner won't add bank cards, absolute nightmare"
Good so far.
I can't made the account it's say you account don't have password
Good
Absolute disgrace so they are inly orered twice from them and both times items were missing from my order got a refund 1st time but 2nd time they are refusing to refund me what was missing from my order absutley raging having to pay for food i didnt get
"Enviam promoções para o meu e-mail nas quais não consigo usar e depois ao entrar em contato com o suporte dizem que eu não fazia parte de um ""grupo qualificado"" para receber a promoção. Sério isso? ""Grupo qualificado""? Por favor né, se não há a intenção de me dar um código promocional para que eu possa usar, não encha meu e-mail com esses spans. Péssimo!"
Good
Extremely expensive and limited. Ordered food on Postmates for literally half the price. Would not recommend.
"Great service, easy to use app quick service"
"Comprei 20 reais de crédito na Uber. Usei 6 e os treze restantes simplesmente desapareceram em menos de 24 horas. O que está acontecendo Uber? I've just bought (yesterday evening) 20 reais in Uber credits. I've used only 6, but, after less than 24 hours, it has just disappeared. What is going on Uber?"
Rubbish app
Ok good
"They allow bicyclist to deliver food, and it took over a half an hour. Nothing like cold cold food...... the cyclist kept changing routes. At least grubhub requires delivery by car for its customers."
Restiarants are shown on the app and are no longer available..
Well laid out app and easy to use
Looove it
I love this app but I think discounts for people that regularly use this app would be very useful
Time saver. Pricey but that's the cost of laziness.
Easy to use!
Super expensive now
"Pathetic customer service. They acknowledged that they made a mistake but did not do anything about it. Just said thank you for your understanding, we hope to take your feedback for future consideration."
Thanks for promotion
Works great
So I will be deleting this app after these past few times of missing food and drinks an then an entire order claimed delivered over 10 minutes away from me... I'm done
Best food app ever.. I love it..easy to use
"Good app, menus are still a little limited if you are familiar with a restaurant some options are missing."
The last four orders I have had mistakes and missing items. The drivers are always nice and appreciative. Customer service is quick and responsive. But all I wanted is the food I paid for. I'm tired of paying for things I didn't want and then waiting two days for a refund.
Great 👍💪
Good service
Delivery prices are expensive
THEY DONT LET YOU GET MACCAS
"Cant unsubscribe from your emailing list, the page never loads, please fix this"
Something is wrong with payment methods and Uber credit or/and credits.
Everything is ok
Good
Iove
"I love the app and its convenience. However, between the service fees and delivery fees are high and the add up very fast!"
Needing more selection.
"Grate,easy and able to track driver"
Love it
Rubbish customer service
My Uber account is not working y tell me
Awesome 👍
My experience has been very good.
I miss Uber eats .
Premiere experience tres decevante une promo livraison gratuit qui expire quand on rentre sa carte de credit. Et apres un tip qui se mes avec un haut pourcentage sans que je le selectione. Un vrai arnaque
"They charged me 2 times for the same order. Instead of just paying 15 for the order like im supposed to, I had to pay 30"
"Very useful service, when I have to work overtime shifts."
Very bad service
✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻
"Placed an order, everything looked fine, 25 minutes later, order was canceled and I was not notified by the restaurant or the driver. Now I have to start all over again. Communication needs to be improved."
Zomato takin over uber eats was the last thing i wanted to happen.... U guys were the best in the market and i hate zomato
Lovely app and lots of deals to keep you interested. Many of your locals are likely on it so no missing out.
Superb
Its easy to get my food
Gud
Great app if your lazy. Lol. Quick and easy to use. It would be nice if you could add comments to what you order especially for whataburger
Very quick and efficient
Very nice very good app
"So far having a great experience with this app, it is very convenient for those times I am unable to get out and about."
🖕🖕🖕🤦‍♂️
Timeous and superb
Nice
Great
Good
Very good service. Helps us in comparing the price of food between different hotels and allow us making rational decision.
Not working.. Always saying something went wrong
is not working
Supe
Good
"I had an unfair review, sure I've had a couple of bad deliveries but they were few and far inbetween. I had a 1-star review at the time, mostly because I was hangry. This app is probably my favorite out there compared to Postmates, doordash, and many others. Keep up the good work!"
Great...
I cant use this app. Am installed but cant entire to this app
Great
"Soy usuaria de hace tiempo y no es la primera vez que me realizan cargos dobles tanto aquí como en Uber. Me han realizado un cobro con tarjeta y cuando he dado propina a mi repartidor me han cobrado su propina y además, mi pedido nuevamente. Como mi tarjeta se ha quedado sin fondos, al realizar un viaje con Uber me han hecho el cobro de la cantidad, y termine realizando un pago exagerado por un viaje. Pésimo."
Good
"The Uber app has technical bug. I'm not able to reset the password. Whenever I use to tap on ""forgot password"", You guys never send the reset link on registered mailid. I've tried it number of times, but never got the link till date. Kindly resolve this issue asap. Waiting for your reply."
This app needs to be changed or just stop operating all together!. It's been giving me problems so much! It just declines my card saying I have no funds yet I do. Please look into this problem.
Take down this app now @playstore. Because now uber eats is Zomato. 😍
The best food app in the world
Too slaw deliver...ordering from the restaurant directly more faster
So amazing i am so impress 👏👏👏😚👍😋
Some staff are gentle and always spil my drinks but part from that they fast and kind staff
Very usefll
"Last year i have used uber eats in a different ciuntry. Ever since when i search for deliver, results given are from that country. No matter i use my location etc. App simply ca'nt grasp that im no longer on holiday. Deliveroo it is."
good
"Uber eats should void all bycycles deliveries as food gets cold when they deliver with bycyle. I had to throw so many food for this bycyclers delivery due to cold food. Dont want to waste when ive paid them. System should have option to chose, i.e. motor bike, car & so on Thanks."
Can't login
Very Bad app..! trying to sing up but is not working. Create a new account with a new number in this app but here telled me that already I have an account with this number.
Gd
"Entregadores muito, muito ruins, no geral."
I used too use Uber eats a lot. Spent a lot of time using it in 2019. It helps with hunger cravings and such. The problem is. I spent 2 months missing food or missing items. Sometimes I didn't report it because I didn't care for refunds. I used to like Uber Eats but this is just ridiculous. I'm just gonna use Door Dash. I had to edit this because I was actually missing 8/10 of the meal. I'm so sick of this!!
i love it
"I entered my whole address, but the app instead inserted only the street name, without any other specification (Which I didn't notice). So I had trouble navigating the delivery guy (who wasn't even speaking good czech) to the right address.. I tried to contact any help service, but there are just online forms..."
"Unprofessional, worst experience and worst customer service. Use this app if you want to wait for your food for 2 hours, not being able to cancel it or reach the customer service, and then the food never arrives. And the compensation for all this wasted time? A discount on the delivery fees for my next order! Ridiculous and disrespectful"
Marvelous job I was overwhelmed by the Macdonald's meL that I had delivers insyedad of having to goto the actul restraint. Many thanks but imsrarving again now l I needs a MacDonald breakfast and it's too late
It would be better if we are able to order from two places at the same time without any extra charge
Good experience
Best app

"The driver arrived in time and I love the fact I can see where they are on the app but some of the food was cold when it arrived. The biggest issue is missing food, it's something I can handle but telling your child that there Saturday night treat, is missing the part they wanted the most isn't good. The drivers should be checking what is going into the order and ensure it matches what has been ordered."
The quality of delivery partners in my country is horrible! The delivery person never ring your bell and they deduct the money from your card and tell you are not owed a refund because you were unreachable
Wow
Nice Application 😍
Love the app
Very good
Miss you Uber Eats #from_India
Its not working properly.It take hours to create a account.showing that something went wrong..plaese try again later..😑😑
When I change the home delivery app crashed I restart the app and I can't return to home screen to order bad app
"Terrible app, often glitches and removes previously available restaurants usually just after your tried to place your order. Had a further issues with a double order where they have refused to help or offer a refund despite the issue being down to their patchy app."
"Shop delivery ranges are too small, endless errors and shops go offline without any reason?"
"I ordered on uber eats, my order instead of 10 minutes took more than an hour and was later cancelled, disorganising my plans for the day. This app is not helpful"
Constantly telling me I didn't pay them and then add it on my next bill when I pay the delivery partner CASH and then inky after receive my food after he checks if all the money is there. STOP THIS. STOP IT.
Super
Where can I see the texts from delivery boy? there's no option for it neither for notifications.
Exceptional service frequent discounts
I thought they made it illegal to have expiring gift cards
"Uber eats is excellent! Always receive great service. However, the fees are outrageous! Why would you charge a delivery fee AND a service fee, then have the AUDACITY to ask for a F*****G tip. I understand service is not easy at all. There I like to tip. But after a $15 order turns into $25, I have no motivation to tip. I hope the drivers are benefiting from all those ungodly fees because my tip game with uber eats is very small. 🤨"
Going to Zomato that's so bad
Gd
Will never use use uber eats app again.My order was cancelled but I paid before the time with card.There was no credits or even no refund.Tried using the contact system and it was just as useful as using nothing.I had recieved 3 diffrent drives to deliver my food and they all cancelled.Wouldnt recommend to anyone.
"Very convenient especially like me a busy single Mom to a teen who is very picky to foods she wants to eat. I only need to search on what she wants to eat and then (Tadaaa!!) in just a few minutes,we already have our choice of foods. We love UberEats😄 Lots of Thanks☺️"
Awesome delivery app
"No option to add cooking instructions, remove pickles for example. Also, if you go to the help section it asks you to contact the restaurant without giving you any information how to. And the amount of hassle someone has to go through to find their customer service is simply the company saying don't call us."
"Brilliant, love using the uber eats, fast and reliable"
Zomato is worlds bad application which is in uber eats
The app doesnt work with me
Worst ever!!
You cant cancel an order after someone goes to pick it up. Ridiculous. Especially when they dont tell you it's only breakfast on the app so you waste money.
Good.
It's amazing.
"Easy to use. Great, friendly service"
Good but some times its get delay
"The ""free delivery"" promotion used to rotate evenly between all available restaurants, but now applies to only the worst restaurants in an effort to boost their sales. Avoid Uber eats. Menulog has fairer delivery prices set for your favourite restaurants. And is fairer to their drivers! I will keep posting this review until the free delivery promotion begins to rotate between all restaurants, and not just the poor performing restaurants."
I love living in an area with uber eats... wish all the grill'd stores delivered though
It is super fast delivery and very tasty food thank you
A++
The app doesn't take into consideration your location so it stupidly will give you order from restaurants several miles away instead of the ones close by. It's a sneaky way of getting the user to pay more money.
"Sorry guys, food service is not the business for you. This requires a customer service who can be contacted. There is no tradeoff between cost savings and customer service. The biggest challenge with this service outside urban areas is the lack of delivery drivers. The technical aspects of the app is fine, just the execution is absent."
Best user experience for food delivery. Recommending to add more restaurants in the tally in Dhaka city for us..
"I am living in brickfilds and the app shows "" sorry we can't find your location """
Useless
Good
"The ""free delivery promotion"" is broken. It promises new options after 5 minutes however stays the same and gets into an infinite loop."
Very convenient
Mostly good.
I didn't receive the Sundae Strawberry. It's really very disappointing and I didn't expect this
Bad
Nice
Good
It isnt opening now... it says that we have to use zomato now
This app is very helpful to eat free food
"Very useful, but some time not work."
Excellent
Gud
uber eats was selled to Zomato
First and last time using Uber eats I received wrong order from restaurant but they won't compensate me anyway which I find terrible.wont be using again
Its ok the application bugs out a bit and dosnt respond to my typing sometimes and im not sure why
Why you joined with zomato? Why cant i open uber app? Uber was perfect but now its useless
We really miss you uber eats please come back to india ..eagerly waiting
I ordered food at 1130pm and it's almost 1am and still haven't received my order. The money has been removed from my account and I called the store and the food hasn't even been picked up. Very very bad service
It works it's good
Worst
Always on point!
Awesome
RIP
"Great selection and interface. Incredibly high fees added over the last year. Love the app, but the new service fees, the small order fees, and the new delivery fees have made it almost too expensive to order from."
Ordered food at 9:30ish here it is 11:45 and uber canceled my order! 3-10 days to get my money back???? You take the money right away but i have to wait for the money to get backin my account? Not impressed i will never use them again and i wouldnt recommend them to my worst enemy who was starving!!!
Great app. Excellent service!!
It's a great app and great sevice
Always get my food arrive on time.
Goody app but some problems are there 😇😇😇😇😅😅😅😄😄😄😂😃
Please get uber eats back in INDIA .We love you uber eats.
"I Really Love Uber Eats But Zoamato Made me sad!! Hope uber eats will come again in india one of best Food Service Really missing uber eats Discounts,offers very perfect .........Love Uber eats🤗😇"
Wow
They waste your dam time and take ur money
Love using uber eats. They have the best variety and food is always quick and hot
Awesome 😊
"This issue of combining order deliveries is not on. It would be prudent practice to first ask the customer whether they would like their delivery combined with another in order to decrease delivery costs. Maybe have a Yes/No option on the order confirmation page. Since this thing started my orders are all arriving over an hour late and cold. Make us choose for ourselves whether we want to trade in fast and quality service for a mere R5 cost cut, not force it on us."
Band ku kardi app....ku kara zomato ke saath tie up 😠😠😠😠 Very disappointed 😠
christinao5058ui plz im hungry
"Recent updates have made uber extremely inconvenient, not dependable, unreliable"
"I think this app is great but when it comes to promotions it is not so great. Seems almost as if I'm about to get a promotion, the app is 'malfunctioning' or the card is unusable. The app states if I refer a friend I get 20 dollars when they order for the first time, awesome right? Well, I referred 3 friends, received 20 from each but then I wasn't allowed to get anymore? Why not? It's a way to get more customers so why limit it? I havent seen any print online saying there is a limit."
I'm outside waiting and don't get my delivery
Doesn't work sometimes
Easy way for take out
Great app but super expensive.
Just need to make the courier rating less extensive.
"I had to go several times to my computer to make the other because it would get stuck in ""placing the order""."
Awesome
Fine
"Recebi o primeiro pedido todo errado e agora que eu recebi um SMS de desconto FEVEREIRO 30, apareceu que estou inelegível. É pq eu critiquei o restaurante?"
Not letting me order
Except for the occasional glitch the app pretty decent.
Photos of food helped me to choose what to order
Terrible customer service and very bad operations
This app is stupid as hell!! If people get a new phone number and someone use to have that number it doesn't even let you sign up that's dumb people change numbers all the time..oh well their loss
Nice app to access delicious food with reasonable prices.
"Very bad support service, the one on the other side of the phone doesn't speak english and Dosen't understand english"
Great so far!
Ongoing issues
"Pésimo servicio al cliente, no dan opciones más que decir que sigas esperando a ver si llega tu orden."
Can't drive out to South BA? 👍
Not user friendly
Very useful
Don't waste your time with this app! I had 3 people all on different phones trying to place an online order and every time we went to add our payment it said there was an error. I looked it up online and this is a common issue! I tried 3 different cards. 3 different accounts. And 3 different phones and nothing worked. I ended up ordering on GrubHub even though they didn't have the restaurant we wanted.
Great and reliable
"Their customer service is absolutely terrible. They didn't address a single one of my concerns and just sent me a canned reply. No point in dealing with ""service"" like this when there are other apps that do it so much better"
Love this app!!
Love it
I cant sign back into my account. Idk what email I used or password. Both my fiance and I cant log into our accounts.
👍
Very eficient !!
👍🏾
Amazing
Good but expensive
"Asked me at the start for my password when I didnt even have an account yet, then asked for my email I used to set up with, there wasnt even an option to create an account"
Good
"Love the convenience, the app is always clean, just wish it had a more robust filter system to search by."
"Tried to order, it took all the information and then at checkout said the restaurant was too far. That restaurant should not have been available"
"The service is good but they have a usless order tracking that has to be refreshed every second. Also they closed my account with no reason for ""security reasons""..."
Awesome
"I think is a Great Idea, and no problem with the app...but i cant give a 5 star becouse the prices are now blowing up like crazy which I hate, I understand that it is a pleasure to have someting like that but I think it is too much pay the double... Sad 😢"
Easy to use and easy to track your orders
Order was delayed but food was worth the wait.
"Ripped off. Never using again, never received an order and uber eats cancelled it. I was assured I'd get a refund within 10 days. Waited 15... nothing and was told to go to my bank about it.... 6 weeks later i got a refund by going through my bank to appeal it. Finally gave up and wanted to try again..... Got told i need to pay outstanding amount...for the cancelled order..... before I can order again. Thank goodness for Menulog and Deliveroo and All the other reliable delivery apps."
I enjoy using it this app to order my food and customer service is definitely something Ty Ubereats
The app still has alot of programming problems every time something say its available and I go to complete the order it say it's not available i dont understand what's th point of making it seem like it available sounds like false advertising to me....
"This service has become a money hungry joke. Apparently orders less than $15 incur a $3 ""small order"" fee (it used to be less than $10) and the drive share free delivery option is only for orders that are at least $20, which, if you're ordering for one, is probably more than what your delivery fee will end up being anyway. Postmates it is then"
Too expensive. I rather call the restaurant then get charged all of the extra fees.
We are a little out of the regular delivery area so not a lot of options but the app works great when in regular delivery area.
"malísimo. pedir es un quilombo, te enteras a ultimo momento de que tu descuento de 150 pesos, entre envíos y adicionales terminan siendo 40 pesos. literalmente a último momento. te spamean promos que no podés usar además. re quiero pedir comida, pero no en estas condiciones."
"Sempre foi excelente, serviço transparente e de qualidade. Até que passaram a se eximir de responsabilidade de falhas do serviço onerando ao consumidor. Uma pena. Negar reembolso a alguém que sequer recebeu o produto é inimaginável, mas aconteceu comigo."
Its ok just ok
It's ok the waiting time takes forever sometimes
"Terrible! Why wait almost an hour to cancel the order and refund my money! If I could give 0 stars I would. Ridiculous, especially when app said the Uber driver had already picked up the order. immediately ordered same food from Door Dash. Save yourself the headache and hunger pains and use GrubHub or DoorDash or even a smaller, local service. I can't even call and complain with UberEats. Just so angry"
Good
Good app use it way too much..
Good experience
It takes a while for the order to pop up in my feed and on one order it never came but was never charged either. Other than that pretty happy with the app.
"Easy to navigate, common sense interface"
My orders have turned up incomplete a number of times. So I have at to go through a long messaging process to get my money back for my items missing. But tonight was the last straw. I ordered 3 meals and one happy meal .Ended up being delivered one meal and my drinks. And uber eats have told me that due to me having previously complained about the incomplete orders .They are not going to give me a refund for the food that was missing. This is disgusting. Need to find out my rights.
"Got completely shafted by this company, Waited 3 hours for order that is ""processing"" and support refuses to even reply to me. No number to contact anyone, and at the mercy of some jackass who doesn't bother replying. Never had worse customer service in my life honestly. - Update, Order finally got cancelled and received money back automatically. (not due to customer service)"
Good
🔥
Delivery address updates are deceiving
Great service!!
Love it....On a busy Friday uber eats helps you multi task
They took my money and they dont jave a call center to contact them with
Good
App consistently errors out and won't let me order. Figure out how to maintain the integrity of the app when there is a higher volume of users.
I will love it
THE BEST FOOD APP
"My food was delayed over an hour and when I tried to cancel it, they tried to charge me for canceling the order."
This app is no longer compatible with my samsung galaxy s5. The app can't go 2 minutes without crashing.
Best
This is awesome and time saver!!
Cool
Satisfactory
"Great app, tells you everything, eazy to use, love it"
The fees are too high. And you hardly ever get deals or discounts.
Takes a little long to get a driver. And charges you 14 $ to cancle an order. Kind of rediculouse if you ask me.
"Funciona, porém fica mandando cupons por sms e quando você vai resgatar no app, dão ""não disponível"". Nenhuma ética com o consumidor."
Nice
"Food wasn't delivered. Deliverer could 'accidentally' mark as completed and I couldn't contact the driver after that point. App puts up interface to tip driver after, which is totally inappropriate when your order just got incorrectly completed. Had to jump through hoops to find someone to talk to to get food or a refund. Its impossible to navigate back to an open help chat. Just a bad experience overall and the design of the app contributed to this."
"Ruim. Perde de 10 a 0 para os concorrentes. Além de o layout ser ruim e pouco intuitivo, ele mente no preço da entrega. Quando eu vejo o restaurante é um preço, no carrinho é outro."
Excellence! Great food selections and prices. The food deliverers are always very friendly and considerate
Great. Happy with app and overall service
"This app is awesome for ordering food. Most of the time it works out perfectly. It would be nice if they could give better estimations for the time delivery though, as to maybe include how far away the restaurant is from your address. It's not really ideal when they give a 35 minute approximation for delivery when you come to realize the restaurant is 30 minutes away...receiving cold food and feeling more inclined to tip better for the length of driving the driver endures."
There is not any place to add comments to the order.
I enjoy this convenience when I lack the time to make it myself. I love being able to occasionally find zero delivery fee at some of my favorite spots.
The lack of customer service is shocking.
Scamming ass company. Keeps on taking money out of my account and returning it into my account so many times to confuse me then charges me DOUBLE for my order from 3 WEEKS ago and runs my account into negative.. Customer service is all over the place and nobody seems to be able to help me they just keep telling me to send screenshots and ignore me when I send them !!!! THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND I WILL BE CLOSING MY ACCOUNT AFTER THIS.
Very bad service and if there is something wrong with the order you can't contact the restaurant directly or even uber app directly instead you have to mail them and wait for the respond which ofcourse takes time meanwhile you want to eat ??
Never had a problem
I waited 3 hours for my food through uber eats installed doordash and got it in 20 minutes. Still got charged for the food I never got
Only used twice now but so far it's been awesome
Good
Can't download
Great stuff
She doesn't even get give your food
Great and fast service
I enjoy being able to order from lots of different places HOWEVER the delivery charge it shows is an absolute lie. It should tell you how much delivery is WITH the service fee. 99 cent delivery is an outright lie. My order ALWAYS goes up at least 12-15 dollars EVERYTIME after all the extra fees have been added.
Good
Great
Simple. Great to guide. Amazing drivers. Super offers
It's ok.... Pretty expensive for the delivery costs and fees
I ordered food which was of poor quality and uber sided with the restaurant and basically told me I was wrong
Wont load
Good service
"Not user friendly, can never sign in"
"1 hour waiting and order is cancelled. There's no way to talk to someone. What a disaster. If you're not able to deliver, dont work and stop wasting people's time."
"Rubbish! Managed to upload it after 10mins as it was stuck on 80% for ages. Then when finally had it uploaded it couldn't find the delivery address. In fact it couldn't find any. After uninstalling and attempting to install it again, it couldn't get past 80% install. Not waiting any longer."
The reason I deleted Zomato is because Uber Eats was better in the customer handling an food order. Now Zomato took over. So.. Yaa good bye.
"Tired of this app reminding me to rate it, so there you go. Also, my latest order was wrong."
"Have been using for over a year and my phone number doesnt work any more all of a sudden because it is ""already in use""... great otherwise"
Originally says 20-30 mins for delivery. Then I placed an order and it jumped to an hour. Then the est delivery timer started adding a min about every 10 seconds. Was going to be charged to cancel the order. Tried very hard to find a way to contact Uber for an hour and couldn't find anything. The restaurant gave me a number to call. Uber canceled my order and returned my money but it's been about 1.5 hrs and I not been able to get lunch. Immediately deleted the app.
Cant retrieve email
Great for busy times and lazy days
Decent app unless you want to cancel your order even 30 secs after you made it. Kinda dumb there's zero way to cancel even for a penalty if a driver was sent...
Doesn't work keeps glitching
Don't even get me started This....it happeed to me 5.... Times my order was cancelled...and ... The delivery driver had no contact just dropped my food off somewhere else im here hungry as f*** wait for my food the app says it was delivered .... WHERES MY FOOD SPENT 20 Dollars ... Most of the delivery drivers.... SUCK! I dont trust this app
Doesnt let me order keeps saying invalid number but I've verified my number
Easy to use
It's good
Good service
"ERROR FETCHING SEARCH RESULTS, wont let me past this page , been two days since ice been able to use the app, guess I'll just doordash"
They great
Trying to reset my password and username
Little expensive
Great really
Choice of any place
"Horrible experience, thinks I have an account when I dont"
This is the worst delivery company out there. Save your self the hassle and use another company. They charge you so much for delivery and still can't get your delivers on time or even worst can't even get in contact with delivery drive who has your food. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME !
Good
Absolutely spectacularly tasty....GET IN MA BELLY
OK but driver of pizza delivery got a bit lost
This app has been deprecated. What is it still doing here ?
"Delivery guy just cancelled an order that I've waited for an hour. No refund, nothing. Bad experience"
This app is amazing!!!
I love this app! It's really easy to use and the drivers are amazing and support polite!
The best
So far so good. We will see when it arrives.
"Only thing I can say is, push button get food, I love it"
The worst app ever
"If there was a zero star option i would have given that to you guys, i tried this sick app for the first time i ordered a burger and i didn't even got the burger and that delivery guy marked it as delivered. I tried calling him but no response"
Good
Love uber eats!
Bogus app not user friendly
"Doesn't remind you to change location if our location is off, that's R105.00 of my money gone, then it gives me an option for a restaurant, 50Km away from me, that's stupid, I'm done with uber eats, this is my last order, I'm fed up with your nonsense as soon as my order arrives I'm deleting this rubbish, Why would I want to order in Randburg when I live in Lombardy East? Stupid app"
Love it!!
Couldnt cancel pretty stupid now some driver is going to go to a non eating place to collect nothing!
It's ok
Bad.
"The super flop aap.First time i ordered in this aap. I waited about mora than 1hour but my order couldn't reach to me. And when I called to the delivery boy, he had switched off his mobile. There no option for reporting about that problem in this aap."
"Worst experience ever,I cant order anymore it refuses to take any form of payment I cant amend or edit or add anything"
Terrible. It never lets me even order. There needs to be a check for delivery distance BEFORE you actually order food. And in this case I'm definitely close enough to order. It stalls out on payment and gives no error message. I've built the same order at least 10 times and never gotten it to go through.
"Pretty good service, little pricey tho"
Can no longer order and very frustrating. App freezes when you try to order once a nut allergy advice for schools comes up and won't let me order proceed. Grrr
Delivery fee is worth it if the restaurant keeps the menu updated
I was given a credit but have not been able to use for about a week now
"Easy to use, and the user interface is user friendly."
"Used to be a good app. I canceled my order right away and still got charged for it. Another time, the app froze while I was placing an order and it didn't show it was placed through so I placed another order but both went through so I got charged for both."
No good
Good app
Bloody fool cheating us
"Everytime i use this app to order food they charge my account multiple times, all they do is steal your money and then tell you that they arnt"
I don't want to download zomato but uber eats force me that's now i hate this app .. ubers eats not open I was your good customer But not any more Because uh support zomato
The best part about Uber eats is majority of the item on here are cheaper than Mr D. Well done
"Terrible, the drivers they use dont seem to be delivering orders, cant get through to the drivers or uber. Have had multiple orders take over 24 hours to come up as cancelled or not delivered so I could get a refund from different areas of the uk"
"Drivers always go to the wrong place, despite very clear directions. App frequently crashes, or won't let me edit addresses. Small order fee is insane. Will never use again."
Was very fast all my orders
Uber eats is a great up. But some of your food mark ups from the store price are unreasonable. That's why I rated a 3 which would otherwise be a 5 if it wasn't for the high mark ups.
Best app ever
Love this app
What is this app still doing on play store !!
Bad service
"My very first time ordering right now I WISH I COULD LEAVE 0 STAR ,WHY TAKE AN ORDER IF YOU CAN'T DELIVER And I waited almost 2 hours ONLY FOR THEM TO SAY THAT THE ORDER WAS CANSELSED my CARD WAS CHARGED I WILL BE SUING THEM IF I DON'T GET A REFUND AND THE SAD SAD SADEST THING IS YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK TO A PERSON"
"Good delivery tracking and free delivery promos are a great incentive. Would be ideal if delivery notifications were push ones not just in name, not only when phone is in use. As I always have to open my phone to check, once the screensaver comes on."
Delivery fee is expensive
"Easy to navigate, select and pay. Love the little animations."
"always get discounts, very useful, such wow"
Out of literally many times of ordering via the app only once was not the best experience. In terms of percentages I would say over 95% of the times things go smoothly and using the app is fairly straightforward!
Great service and choice
Very fast delivery and correct. Great delivery driver and friendly x
"I'm in Chennai.I was really love the Uber eats but today, i was add a fried rice in my cart and i open the cart to make delivery but my cart was empty . I was go back to the menu to order again but no hotel are shown only one hotel. I don't know why this happened to me.This problem was solved by uber service thanks."
Works well.
"My daughter bought me a $75 gift card from Kroger and Uber refuses to apply the credit and will give me no reason. They posted the credit to my account so it cant be refunded but they wont allow the credit to be applied to any of my orders....so basically, they stole my $75 and refuses to give me a valid reason....call Postmates instead....i never had a problem with Postmates."
"I have never used uber eats. Just got the app, opened it and on the page where it says get started, I entered my phone number and it tells me that your account does not have a password. So back to mr delivery again."
FOOOOOD
Very good
كان ليا رصيد فلوس لا عارفه هما فين والسواق قالى انهم فى المحفظة ولا عارفه فين المحفظه ولارجعولى اى فلوس
good app
They don't have enough drivers in my area. Several times have canceled my orders due to no delivery drivers. Their customer service reps are the worst and they clearly don't care about making the customer happy because so many other people use the service.
Uber im really missing you a lot zomato pricing much than you Really feeling so for you please come back ASAP I can't order food for my price in zomato & i'm not blaming zomato but missing you uber Love u uber
So far it has been Great to use and I would highly recommend it over Grubhub and Seamless!
Delivery took forever! And there is no way to message the driver!
Useful app
Super
Food is always cold
1 star is generous. Never worked for me once no matter what restaurant I went to
"It looks like the uber eats app has downgraded, I cant see where my driver is, my order was ready for over 15mins too and I cant message customer service to figure out any problems with my order.."
Applicition not working....
"Horrible and outrageous. I ordered some food and they took my money, then the app went down. With no way to contact support (other than in the app which isn't working) I have no idea what happened to my order and I can't get my money back. Horrible service and I'll be uninstalling this joke of an app."
Every single time I use this app even when I update it it freezes and stops working at least 20 times before I actually get it to work. No other app including doordash does this. No matter how many times I update this app it continues to freeze and close out and I have to start everything over from the beginning as much money as we pay on Uber Eats this app needs to be fixed
Terrible
Good
Good
Very fast
Great
It was a good experience but the app is a little cumbersome to use and call when selecting additional items
it's very nice
Fast deliver good app could have voucher for Money of or earn point for free food would make it better
"Most of the time my food comes the way I want and with utensils. However the app is not perfect. Edit 02/07/20: Hello, so firstly I wish it was easier to report if something happened to your order so you can be reimbursed. I also wish there was a way for the restaurant to let you know if they're out of an item as I've gotten the wrong food delievered to me as well in addition to not getting utensils even when checking the option."
It is not starting in 2020
Can not find any cancel button before or after picked up order by a food man
Happy to have u.
Great offers
Appalling service
"Was originally 5 stars until I noticed all of the additional fees that have been added over time, mostly use door dash due to the added fees and shipping is usually alot cheaper."
It's so dumb how I can order from a restaurant on skip the dishes but not on Uber eats. If skip was open sooner I'd only use skip. For example one restaurant that is available on skip the dishes will not be available on Uber eats. I also work literally 5 minutes away from my house and Uber eats will deliver to my office but not my house that is even sometimes closer than the office to the restaurant. I don't understand that.
Waste of time! Don't even download it! My first order was predicted to come at 8:55. It kept being pushed back until it got canceled at 9:52!!! What the hell kind of service is that? I had a $20 cash tip ready for the driver too!! UPDATE: Tried it for a second time because they gave me a 15 dollar off coupon. My order was a lot earlier than last time. But alas my order still got canceled. Do not try until maybe a few years down the road and the figured this out better!
Worst app ever!
Wow the worst app ever
आई लव यू उबर हिट
Good
Its suck it will not let me order from my place
You should have never given it to zomato...
too good
Too slow
Good
Great!
why it is acquired by zomato. I don't like this. I m not able to get good offers now.
Don't download it ...It has been acquired by Zomato..
Uber eats does not deliver in my location Emdeni but im just 10/15 min away from Jabulani Mall. So I downloaded it for nothing
Quick and fresh foods. Easy access
I ordered food at 12:55 and at 4 it still hadn't arrived.
I hang up at the location and notify me..i can't go back to the main menu to make an order. ...
Why isn't my phone number getting signed in! I can't even enter the app It just crashed 😔
I dont know but the app is now own by zomato .. so why the hell they are giving updates for this app ???
I was busy browsing through then before I could even finish choosing stuff my money had been deducted from my account. Then I immediately looked for an option to cancel which was also a nightmare to find. Finely found that option under the help option and pressed cancel my order and it was buffering the whole time and then I contacted the driver and advised him that I was not done. He asked if I wasn't going to take my food I said no because I was not done ordering but he still came and called m
"Delivery on this app is terrible. Delays are frequent, and food often never arrives on time for me, sometimes going over an hour (worst case, two) after the estimated time of arrival."
"Crapy company, you know you SUCK when there is no way to contact said company. Stop ruining business reputations because the users are stupid. Ice melts morons. Don't order food that melts then complain it melted..idiots... Update: I can't respond in the app because there is no support option other than checking for for help topic. Also had to create an entire new account because there was zero option to log in, only create an account."
"Uber Eats coverage area currently cuts off about half a mile from my house in Upminster About 75% of the town is covered, but not my road. It's been coming soon for months. The cut off border appears to be completely arbitrary, as some parts of the same road are in coverage, while some are not !"
Excellent
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Love Food love Uber Eats 😁
HOW do I view the address of the place I want to pick up from? Like I don't see it anywhere.... It just shows the distance like 2.3m with no other information. Pretty useless.
Nice
"After waiting for one hour, the order gets automatically cancelled. Food is never delivered."
Nice
I got a new phone went to the app to login and it doesn't let me login it wants to setup a new account. Which I can do because my email address is already in use. You don't understand when I open the app it doesn't give me an option to sign in so I can't use the app. Your help I useless
Awesome
"If it's delivered, it's great! I've had orders pending for almost an hour and all of a sudden get canceled. I had one order cancel, I call the store and they said they had no idea why it was cancelled, the driver had picked up my order. Customer service apologizes but that's it. I rate orders, half the time missing something and never get reimbursed for that or for wasting an hour waiting on food and then it getting cancelled. Doordash is way better and reimburses you for poor service."
Describe my experience ? Easy ! Horrible 🙃
It wont even let me send start to the number.
"The app is really good, just sometimes the service is not up too standard. Paying £20 for a meal that's cold and Uber only give you £5 back to say sorry!"
Great
"I can't Log in to Uber eats. It says, 'Unable to log in, try again later'"
"Fantastic service. Helpful when you're not in the mood for driving out to get food or when the weather isn't too friendly. Just wish they had pictures in the menu items, then I'd give them a 5 star rating"
love it
"Very friendly delivery and fast,food is always hot"
Professional
When I order my food it keeps telling me I owe money's when I clearly I only buy with cash so this does not make sense!
So easy to get great food. Love it.
There's no way to cancel an order you've placed. A lot of restaurants are missing condiments. We
Galat hai
Great
"The app puts a random adress. Got my delivery in a wrong adress. And there was no way to find any instant support or help from the app. So technically there were no solutions. And also the app said i will be next time charged for no-shows. Despite the fact that I talked to my delivery guy who was, so nice and tried to help but he was helpless. Oh yeah, and such a disapointment, there is no functioning email to contact those who refuse to truly help. The app itself never showed any help."
Goog apps
I haven't registered it from my new no. But it is showing that I was already signed
Amazing
Consistently get a my bloody order wrong!
"Not a great selection still and you pay extra via uber eats to use the same takeaways other apps also use. Biggest issue is nothing ever arrives within the advertised time, the uber eats delivery service is very poor and always late, often substantially. Getting customer service via the app seems purposefully long and difficult. My last 2 orders from McDonald's were quoted as 15-25mins and arrived 1hr 30mins later, that is not an operational delay, that is poor implementation of sevice."
The prices of food on the app are more expensive than walking into the store or online. The delivery prices have jacked up massively to the point where it's not worth it.
"""Tonight, I'll be eating.... nothing!"" Order: #EAA38 I placed an order at approximately midday with the promise of a 12:40pm delivery. It is now 9:14pm with the app still trying to find a driver. I called the restaurant in which they said the food was ready to pick up at 12:30pm however the app still stated ""food is being prepared"". I've called uber eats 4 times in total and emailed twice but keep getting bounced around. Still no answers..."
Excellent
new to uber eats. so far really good service and food. only had one late delivery but otherwise very happy.
Bad
Timely and efficient
Easy to use
Good
Cool
"Don't use the app if you're going to use a Visa debit card, they'll take money from your account days after you've already paid. Don't bother trying to get a refund, they just act stupid and say they don't have it on file. They stole about 122.00 dollars from me in one morning, no joke or exaggeration. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. PERIOD."
Worst app
Good Service
Other drivers are unprofessional!
"Love it... Except that sometimes drivers cancel the order saying they tried to contact you, but they definitely haven't... Also, needs to expand to places that aren't yet available..."
"Good app and good selection of choices, however the ~20% food cost markup and delivery fees are brutal. What would have cost maybe $15 in-person takeout ends up being almost $30 after delivery fees and item cost increases! Free delivery and promos are ok time to time, but it's not dependable and is far outweighed by surcharges..."
Opening app shows a prompt to enter an address but then shows that there is an error and address cannot be found.
"Its too much bad and disgusting app.takes 2hr for preparing food, another 2hours to take food and another 2hours for bringing it...too much time consuming and irritating app"
"No one from Uber reads your problem, they simply just resend you the form you've already submitted when you requested help the first time.. but again how am I supposed to give you the email and card information associated with my cellphone number if I NEVER CREATED THE ACCOUNT. Therefore it would be impossible for me to give you information I do not have? I'm sure the person who used to have my number created the account. Developer: go for help. Help: ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!!!"
"Used to be a great app, but as their delivery price went up the customer support went down. Upon showing evidence of missing items from an order they couldn't provide a full refund. Late deliveries became very frequent too."
Extremely poor verification system.
Driver never arrived with order. I had to ring the store to find out where my order was. They told me I couldn't pick up my pizza after waiting an hour. Unbelievable.
"Great services, timely. Was able to surprise my guests on time."
Good
Extremely worst service. I wish I could give them a negative marking.
😍
Easy to use
I just finished slamming this app for lack of support response then all of a sudden it starts working on the latest update! Fast work! Hehehe...
Love it
"CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. No number, the ridiculous messenger was pissing me off. I told them to read what I wrote and their response was 'We are reading what your are saying. We are not robots here.' Not to mention the ridiculous delay in response. ******* How do you expect me to type more when all I've got is 500words. It was a series of events."
Please uber eats back
I kid you not uber eats was my bestfriend before and after having a baby. Cravings satisfied and I had no time to cook when baby arrived so uber eats made it so easy and convenient to order. Absolutely love the app.
"So I will never use Uber Eats or Uber EVER again. Their system has apparently been down since this morning but they are still taking orders. Was told to call back in an hour to get a refund but not sure I believe them. No call from Uber to notify of the outage and why is their app still up and running when their system is down? NOT IMPRESSED, NEVER AGAIN!"
Very useful app & easy to use.
"Complained about food arriving cold due to uber greediness, putting the same guy delivering several orders and my food arrived completelty cold and soggy. Uber doesn't consider as a reason for refund. Uninstalled and won't use it anymore. (I tried 3 times resolving the issue inside the app, your support says it's not a reason for refund)"
The attitude of delivery boy is very rude. Its nt a personal issue with him. I want to explain my experience with uber eats is very bad. I ordered minimum 4 to 5 times . All the orders are undeliverable to me bcz of many excuse made by delivery boy. I appreciate there hard work but i didn't understand their attitude. 1 delivery boy reached my place to deliver the food . He stood infront of my flat & said to wife to pick the order from ground floor . I m nt payable to go 3rd floor & cutt the call
Nice
Worst service in Bangladesh...
I can choose the food I want but the can't otdrt it.yesyes. you don't even allow an option for yes in the Rev.
"I installed the latest update yesterday after another battle placing an order, hoping that will sort things out. After the update my 2xR50 discount promotional offers that was loaded and valid to use until today shows that is has been used - i'm so over this app"
"Good app,dont use it during night its bugs and you gotta pay a 15$ fee do cancel the order"
Nice
Not very easy to use
Great!
Good
Works fine. I'm just surprised that there isnt a mandatory way to make users choose which address to deliver to. The little you're far away reminder doesn't always pop up. Making users pick an address before delivery can stop a lot of problems before they start. Heck even amazon makes you choose an address before buying unless you have 1 click settings on.
Best app
Very nice app
I waited 3 hours just for them to not show up
GoodnightWalaikkum
Yeh bik gayi hai...
Good service
Love this app. Handy af for getting things when you get back from work and you can't be bothered cooking. So many options and great delivery people.
"So easy to use, what more can you ask for. Great to have a customer centric app"
"Awesome 🍱🥡🍔🍗🌯🍕🍝🍜🍲, Except for when your drivers run over my sprinklers 🤬😡😮, & still not home cold ❄ Alcohol ❄️delivered"
Easy 😀
superb!
"The food delivered was rotten, one of the sandwiches had paper inside of it, and it is like pulling teeth trying to get a refund. ...right after posting the review I got a full refund. I will try this app one more time...the restaraunt had a 4.8 star rating...so I cant seem to trust that...if things get better i may leave more stars if worse it goes back to a 1"
"This app is a scam, they offer free delivery if you order through certain companies but when you do, they charge you a delivery fee and refuse to refund it."
Its zomato... Uber eats gone
Quick and quality assured
Awesome way to get food
I made an order that was never delivered. The restaurant never received the order from Uber eats. I called uber eats and was rudely informed that it was not their problem (at uber eats). I will make sure I turn as many people as possible away from uber and uber eats. Lyft and door dash are better anyway.
Good experience overall
Excellent
Just delightful
Useful
Wish I could get more deals. But it's definitely handy to have on lazy days
I ordered a 20 piece and received 17 pieces.
Satisfied with service
"Misleading tracking info, confusing app navigation, and frequent crashes on top of poor customer service."
Excellent
Good and fast
"No resolution for delay, no way to call restaurant or contact customer care. Pathetic"
Great
Excellent & very friendly service
Good job
Excellent
We always get great service when we order from uber eats.
They cancelled my order and didn't tell me.
Fantastic
"Not impressed. Ordered pizza and the uber WALKED it to my home. It was raining, It came cold and wet!! Decided to try again tonight from the same place. Another uber WALKS. It will be cold as its -5 and snowy outside. The order came transported in.a backpack and on its side during delivery, the focaccia that went with my dish was totally soggy from being smushed with the eggplant parmesan. It was gross. I will not order a third time."
"food is always cold, always late delivery"
"Delivery fees are high. It can deter one from giving a good tip. Also, lately I've had a strip of items missing. Please address issue, then I'd be happy to give 5 stars."
Paid for food that was never sent out
Very reliable. They blow skipthedishes out of the water. Food actually arrives hot. Unlike skip the dishes. Customer support is helpful. Unlike skip the dishes. You can actually talk to your carrier. UNLIKE SKIPTHEDISHES. You get my point. Pick these guys over skip the garbage.
Well the food was tossed every where the delivery was expensive 20 $ of nothing but service fee .. no condiments with the food was every where will not use it ever again and will not recommend
Horrible. I have a giftcard that was given to me and it won't allow me to use it. It took me over an hour. 3 calls to customer service one agent hung up on me. I had to make a test order to see it it worked. Now the second order wouldn't work. You need to do better.
The app from a ui stand point needs work.
They told me my driver was picking up my order and made me wait 20 minutes before telling me my order was delayed because the driver doing other orders first. They shouldve said something a lot sooner
It says a store that is located 8 mins by car is too far for delivery??? Ridiculous.
I always have problems with payment even though I have money on my card
"There's a restaurant near my area which is attended only by PostMates and Uber Eats. Her Eats says that the restaurant is far away from my location and can't serve while PostMates has no problem delivering their food. Post Mates doesn't include some of the food items from their menu, while UE does. But this is disappointing."
Great
just great
"Love the app...great deals and a nice variety of different foods , coffee and dessert options"
Normal I'd say this app was fine as I dont like leaving bad reviews however after it's been a week sense they charged me twice and everytime I contact support they have been unhelpful. I ended up paying 85 dollars for one meal that costs 39 dollars. I will not be using this app again and if they hit you with the authorization hold there really just charging you twice and good luck to seeing your money back.
Awesome app
You seriously need to tell people that they need to know how to navigate around an apartment complex.
I keep spending money
"How can I enter my information if there is nowhere to enter said information. It only has the registration steps and when I enter my email, it says the email has already been registered. Where am I supposed to enter my information?"
Its was amazing
It brings me food in exchange for dollars. What's not to love?
"If I could give no stars, I would. I've tried to use Uber Eats twice now. Both times my orders weren't delivered. Customer service is awful and basically non existent. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was hung up on. Will NEVER use this service again."
Fast and easy
Love it
"They hide an additional service fee in the ""taxes section"". You should have a delivery fee or a service fee. Not both. Will be canceling my subscription until you are more upfront about your charges."
My order never arrived
"The worst food delivery app out there. I was twice accidentally disconnected by customer support staff before receiving a refund I did not want and did not ask for (that will take a week to process. I was a loyal customer, but after this most recent experience, I have deleted the app and deleted my entire Uber account. I will be considering filing a complaint with my Consumer Bereau due to the extremely unprofessional behavior of the driver, support staff, and the company's practices as a whole"
Food is hot and gets to destination on time....food is very good and tasty
"I am a truck driver and sometimes I dont have time to stop, so I have waba grill delivered to the account and eat while being unloaded. Very convinient. p.s. always tip your driver and rate your restaurant/ Edit- I rated this in Feb of 2018 and it's now Feb 2020 and this service is has become deceitful. 1)they are now charging you for delivery fee and service fee, they're the same thing. 2)they keep raising the minimum for a small order fee, from 10 to 12 to now 15, it's not worth it anymore."
I hate how much I love this service! Will I ever have the strength to delete this app from my phone??? Probably not.😁
Couldn't open app. Constantly crashing.
"Too many extra charges for delivery, service and other taxes. I can buy a full meal with the taxes included 😔😔"
Fast and friendly
I can't even see any restaurants. It just takes me to the point AFTER an order is made confirming my address and such. And i JUST downloaded the app. Deleting it now.
I've only used it once but my first impressions are very good
So convenient!!!
I did not receive my order and still I did not get a refund uber please help
A good experience 👍
order wrong took 15 mins to sort out credit toreorder by time this happened the shop shut
Always get my food fast and it's much cheaper than grub hub
"I actually get the food I order about 40% of the time, maybe less. Almost every time I use this app to get food, nobody picks up my food or brings it to me. Worst experience with an app ever. I dont even review apps. Ever. But this is ridiculous. This app has one job and most of the time I dont get any food delivered to me, just a message saying ""we're sorry, your order has been canceled"" hours after I put the order in. DO NOT USE THIS APP, USE SOMEONE ELSE"
Order came wrong items got milk shake instead of mcflurrys
The best to get food in home
2nd order in a roll where the app doesn't recognize where your located causing order to be delivered to an address YOUR NOT AT!
Expensive but great. Get the foods you like delivered to you .
Horrible !! Wouldn't recommend
When your bored of eating home cooked meals and nothing in the house this app is lit
Food was cold.
Easy
Worst delivery app ever used waited 2hrs and had to cancel in the end No help what so ever will be cancelling my app for good this time 2nd time now not happy
Love Ubers recognize each driver
"Pro usuario pode até ser bom, agora para a aprovação do motorista é péssimo com informação zero!"
"Two years later 2020 and the service hasnot improved, constantly getting food wrong, missing items Orders are often incorrect, spilled, missing items. To the point when I ask for a refund, I'm accused of fraud. Even when showing photographic evidence."
I wish you could contact store or delivery person sooner...
"Removing the live chat from the app and replacing it with a generic ""I'm not happy form"" is counterproductive instead of resolving an issue in minutes it now takes 3 to 5 days. I understand the need to keep costs low but it shouldn't sacrifice customer service. There are now other cheaper and more customer friendly apps available."
Quick and reliable unlike grub hub
I have utilized this service 3 times. The first quoted me 25 min and it took over an hour to receive my order. The 2nd my order was incorrect and had half of the food missing. The third and final order took over and hour and 16 min and still no one has picked up the order to deliever and there isnt an easy cancel order button. I could of gotten it myself at this rate.
I love it.
Verygood
"Omg, no."
رههههيييب
Fast & Easy
Having someone deliver your food and convient especially when your disable
"This is a brill app, the no minimum pay out is awesome. But the delivery fee excessive which is why it's not 5 stars"
Ubers eats best app . But Uber eats app not working 😭
عدم التزام بالمواعيد بطريقة متكررة وتاخير يصل اكثر من ساعتين، من اسوء تطبيقات توصيل الطعام
Muy buena
Can you order food with cash?
I love it
The app itself is great but so many times I get the wrong food item or missing items
Bought wrong order
"Bad app feture,when i regester my Number ur app told someting is wronge what is this???"
Quick to deliver!
"Uber eats is very convenient, but I get the message ""Internal Server Error"" ALL THE TIME when trying to order food. My Uber app is up to date and I use a Pixel 2 XL. There is nothing more frustrating then being hungry and counting on a delivery service to facilitate my needs, then not having them come through. I'm also an Uber Pass member. For God's sake, hire better devs/programmers Uber."
Always on time and reliable drivers.
My order took 3 hours to come. Bad service I tell you
Everytime my order is incorrect
"Buggy, shows you restaurants that are too far away, then once you spend 10 minutes building an order the app says there is a server error (which basically means its too far away). Need to knock on wood and cross your fingers for an order to go through..... You guys need to fix this buggy app!"
Good layout of site
"Old versions work, but it still requires too many mandatory updates, which makes it unreliable. Also, the new version needs camera access and stays running in the background. Hmmmm EDIT: and they don't read the review texts either. How does clearing the cache remove camera access and the other abusive permissions it asks for?"
"It's to my liking, really easy and simpke"
"Man ,now my money was taken, and my food not arrived"
"In a $85 order with free delivery by the restaurant, they charge me $23.50 as a ""fee"" (total $108.50). Really? Other apps do a MUCH better job. Other than the outrageous ""fee"" of more than 25% of my order, the app works fine and has an easy to use interface, but that is not enough when you have other options doing the same and charging you a third of what Uber Eats does."
Excellent
Showed a place open that wasnt and i still got charged
"Driver cancelled when ""3 minutes away"" after waiting for our food for 35 minutes."
Excellent
Pathetic customer service unless you don't report bad service.
I ordered about $40 worth of food at around 2:40 AM. The app told me it would arrive latest time by 3:30 AM.. the food got to my house around 4:15 AM and it was absolutely disgusting.. I order about $1000 of uber eats a month and almost never complain and they refused to give me a credit or return my money for a meal that was disgusting because of their error... crappy place.
I ordered food and had to go collect it myself because apparently Uber drivers don't drive in the rain
Nice one no complain
Easy to use.You can find what Your look for
I will never use again. First let's just say that it took my order 2 hours to be picked up. I myself ended up picking up my order before my Uber Eats driver. The great thing about it is ubereats did refund my money so I'm very appreciative of that. I hope that this can be resolved in better time management thank you and have a great day.
"Pointless, they emailed me offering me a deal to sign up and then tell me they dont cover my area."
After couple of orders which I made before I was satisfied with the result and service until last two orders which I paid with tips and never get my food delivered... After spending an hour to try to fix the issue when I supposed to eat already to get your money back. I don't know what's wrong with drivers get the food and never show up. Absolutely ridiculous.
Over time. The customer service has taken a massive nose dive. Sick of the bad service. I am deleting the app. Have been ordering food for a number of years now. But it is clear that it is better I take my business somewhere else. Thank you for the violent illness from the last delivery. And your complete disregard for my health or satisfaction as a customer.
Easy!
Sell outs😒
You need to scan your card to verify your account. But 0 options if it won't scan your card.
"After an hour and a half wait for an order to arrive due to their system failing and not finding a new driver after the original cancelled, they wont even offer a refund or compensation. Done using this app and having this happen to me. Just use SkipTheDishes or DoorDash instead."
It's easy to use. I like the free delivery options every 15 minutes.
Super convenient and easy
Love it....
Now Why ?? Uber Eats Now Zomato.... Na Then ??
Good app
Great
So sad dat its overtaken by zomato
"Very bad, I can't access the site because my email is already registered and it won't let me go further"
"I adored this service until i learned that your charged full price even if your food is wrong, half eaten or doesnt even show up. There is no way to resolve these situations, you cannot get any employee on the phone and it is frustratung beyond words to not get what you ordered and still have to pay. There needs to be a way to handle complaints,overcharges and no shows."
"The app itself is fine, but they moved to using bicycles which leaves food cold. Missing items on orders also has become a problem, we used this app for a long time to get food now searching for other options."
Bad experience every time they change the delivery time with no customer service to talk with and this is not the first time Really shame on uber
"Be warned, no safe gards against fraud. Had a very very bad experience with the application and support is poor for South African Users 0/10 would use again."
Good app
Good
Ok Uber Eats food
Bad service
"Stole my money, it's better to actually go to the restaurant than pay a ""service fee"" and never receive part of your order. Customer service is a joke but it's slightly better than other ordering apps. Slightly being the keyword here."
Exceptional service
Unable to update payment method through the app and online
I have used this app many times. And have never had a bad experience.
"Customer service is a joke. If there is an issue from their side, don't count on them helping. They'll just tell you to try again or use their website instead of the app. Use corporate guidelines as an excuse to dismiss you."
خدمه زي الزفت
Great app
Vallagche
"Uber Promo voucher expires before expiry date, screenshot available as proof, can't get any backup support for Uber eats South Africa, frustrating........"
Fabulous
Very easy and convenient
One of the worst and most expensive food delivery apps. I've caught drivers picking up other orders while they were supposed to be delivering mine. This has made the food I receive cold.
App absolutely does not work at alm anymore! P.O.S.
Works fine
رائع
New user does not create account
The app will not let me verify my payment method
Miss You UberEats India ❤
Great app
"You should probably worry about your thousands of sexual assaults that occur in your Ubers a year, just here in the US alone, but when you have time, please fix your janky website and password recovery system. It gives no option to recover by email, all I wanted was some damn Starbucks for breakfast and my car isn't available today. I no longer have the phone or number I used to. Thanks for nothing. Back to Grubhub & Doordash I go, they allow password recovery by email. I won't be returning to UberEats or Uber."
I order form here and uber and travel from USA to Brazil what's the problem
Muy buena
Yayyy food
Satisfactory
Very good service always arrives on time.
Good
Great
I was just browsing tha app and trying to look for a meal to order then suddenly there was a note popped up that the order was succesfully placed and on its way. I quickly called the restaurant to cancel as it is not the order I wanted but they instructed me to call ubereast. I called ubereats and they informed me it can be cancelled but I will be charged cancellation fee as the order was placed already. You shoud check your application why it's suddenly placing orders withour permission.
"Off lately yhe food is late,and poorly packed,last order my coffee was spilled all over my order"
Very nice and easy
I have always been having issues with there service I'd suggest getting skip instead of this
Don't like bakwaas
"Money is everything for uber , is now owned by Zomato , No more cheap food."
Good descounts
"Easy,fast,reliable"
Awsome
"First time user. Went to get it setup, typed in my number. Said I already have an account but it's not my email"
"Ordered on wrong address, they canceled and didnt charge me. Best service ever"
"I am utterly disgusted with the service here in Dhaka. If you can't work professionally, you shoud stop harassing us. Uninstalling now."
Amazing how efficient this was
Prompt service. Never have had an issue so far
No customer service number with ongoing issues
Easy to use.
Given promotion revert back just before check out. Cheating maybe. Your service are good but the rating I given for that bad experience
I am trying to sign up for uber eats as a driver and I am stuck on the 'choose a city' page
5 stars
Service not good
Excellent app
To hard to.get an otp.....if u forgot ur password u miss life like situation....hell with it..
I do not like it
Super
Good
If there's no driver you'll wait until your food gets cold. There's no way to contact uber eats when this happens and they provide no credit. I don't advise using this app. Highly disappointed.
Wish I could give a zero.
بصراحه رائع
Good apps
Better
Reasonable prices and prompt service.
It's connected with zomato
Very quick and easy to use doing a lot less cooking though some say that's a good thing 😁
Love it
Thanks for the offers. Really great
Changing my view as my recent experience was good...
Bad since zomato acquired it
More promotions would be nice..
Pathetic
Best app añd pocket friendly for students. I request you to start the application as soon as possible . Far better than Zomato and swiggy
Poor. Had to uninstall as it refused to accept my Mastercard for payment despite using the camera function. Gave up in the end and drove to order instead. No phone to contact either.
Worst
They don't always have Ubers available in my town
What about Uber Credits? As from 21-01-2020 Uber Eats acquired by Zomato.
Very Good
Convinient
السلام عليكم لماذا كل ما ادخل رمز خصم ٦٠ ريال وانا ولا مرة طلبت يصير يرجعني ويقولي لا يستطيع الطلب ارجو حل المشكلة
It didn't take my order but took the money from my account.
Worst app Otp isn't coming I've tried 10 times
Shittiest app ever experienced in my life. Signin problem never gets solved.
Account password and need to order food🙆🙆🙆
Uber Eats debited R50 from my personal bank account with my permission.
I dnt want to use ZOMATO not happy Request you please I love to order on uber eat not 👉👎👎👎👎ZOMATO sorry

❤️ ubereat.
Always excellent
Not taking delivery address how many times law staff so many times I am. Added but adding Moto Service also this app
