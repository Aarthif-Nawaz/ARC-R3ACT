Every collaborator has to make their branch and name of it should the feature they are working on. For example: Safiyyah is working on Sentiment Analysis so the branch name she has to give for her branch would SentiAnalysis. Likewise the rest of youll have to choose appropriate names. Please don't merge anything to the master branch, without all of us testing. Commit at least once a week. 
Safiyyah - SentiAnalysis.
Sajani - UI
Shiromi - Backend/ API
Christina - Clustering
Ridmi - FeatureExtraction
Aarthif - Text Pre-processing.
Please dont mess with anyone's branch but if you need something from someone's branch download that portion.
